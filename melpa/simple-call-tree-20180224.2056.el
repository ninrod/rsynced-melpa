;;;; Introduction:
;; This library is based on simple-call-tree.el by Alex Schroeder, but you
;; do not need that library to use it (this is a replacement).
;; It displays a buffer containing a call tree for functions in source
;; code files. You can easily & quickly navigate the call tree, displaying
;; the code in another window, and apply query-replace or other commands
;; to individual functions.

;; When the command `simple-call-tree-display-buffer' is executed
;; a call tree for the functions in the current buffer will be created.
;; The user is also prompted for other files to include in the call tree.
;; The call tree is displayed in a buffer called *Simple Call Tree*,
;; which has a dedicated menu in the menu-bar showing various commands
;; and their keybindings. Most of these commands are self explanatory
;; so try them out.

;;;; Navigation:
;; You can navigate the call tree either by moving through consecutive
;; headers (n/p or N/P keys) or by jumping to main branches (j for branch
;; corresponding to function at point, and J to prompt for a function).
;; When you jump to a branch, it is added to `simple-call-tree-jump-ring',
;; and you can navigate your jump history using the </> keys.
;; You can also add the function under point to the jump-ring with the . key.
;; If you use a negative prefix (e.g. C--) before pressing j then the branch
;; jumped to will not be added to the jump-ring.
;; If you have fm.el (available here: http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sje30/emacs/fm.el)
;; you can press f to toggle follow mode on/off.

;;;; Display
;; Normally child branches correspond to functions/variables called by the parent
;; branch. However, if you invert the tree by pressing i then the child branches
;; will correspond to functions that call the parent branch.
;; You can sort the tree in various different ways, and change the depth of the tree.
;; You can also narrow the tree to the function at point by pressing /

;;;; Exporting:
;; The tree can be exported in its current state with the `simple-call-tree-export-org-tree'
;; command, and you can alter the types of links with the `simple-call-tree-org-link-style' option.
;; This may be useful for project management.

;;;; Refactoring
;; You can perform `query-replace' or `query-replace-regexp' on the function at
;; point by pressing % or C-%, or any other arbitrary command by pressing !
;; This may be useful when refactoring.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put simple-call-tree.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'simple-call-tree)
;;
;; You might also want to define a key for creating the call tree,
;; e.g. like this:
;;
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c S") 'simple-call-tree-display-buffer)

;;; Acknowledgements:
;;
;; Alex Schroeder - the creator of the original simple-call-tree.el
;;
;;

;;; TODO
;;
;; Use / key for filtering headers by name (for consistency with other modes such as gnus & dired)
;; and use a different key for narrowing to the current header.
;;
;; If anyone wants to implement the following ideas, please do:
;; More reliable code for building tree (handle duplicate function names properly).
;; Fix code so that we can have several calls to the same function in the same tree.
;; Code for managing refactoring commands (to be applied to marked functions).
;; Multiple query replace command for substituting appropriate lisp macros -
;; e.g. replace (setq list (remove x list)) with (callf2 remove x list)
;; Code for finding (and highlighting?) duplicate code and other code smells (difficult).
;; Idea: break each function down into a list of keywords for the language in question,
;; and look for common subsequences (not too short) among functions.

  "Alist of major modes, and information to use for identifying objects for the simple call tree.
Each element is a list in the form '(MAJOR-MODE VALID-FONTS INVALID-FONTS START-TEST END-TEST) where:

MAJOR-MODE is the symbol for the major-mode that this items applies to.

VALID-FONTS is either nil or a list of fonts for finding objects for the call tree (functions/variables/etc).
If nil then `simple-call-tree-default-valid-fonts' will be used.

INVALID-FONTS is either nil or a list of fonts that should not be present in the text properties of
any objects to be added to the call tree. If nil then `simple-call-tree-default-invalid-fonts' will be used.
The invalid fonts will also be checked when finding function calls.

START-TEST indicates how to determing the start of the next object. Potential objects are found by checking
the fonts of tokens in the buffer (against VALID-FONTS). If START-TEST is a function then it will be used as
an additional check for potential objects. It will be passed the buffer position of the beginning of the
current token to check, and should return non-nil if it represents a valid object.

NEXT-FUNC is an alternative way of determining the locations of functions.
It is either nil, meaning the function locations will be determined by fonts and maybe START-TEST,
or a function of no args which returns the position of the next function in the buffer, or nil if
there are no further functions.

END-FUNC indicates how to find the end of the current object when parsing a buffer for the call tree.
It can be either a function taking no args which moves point to the end of the current function,
or any non-nil value which means to use the `end-of-defun' function, or nil which means that font changes
will be used to determine the end of an object.

START-REGEXP a regular expression to match the beginning of a token, you can probably leave this blank.
By default it is \"\\_<\".

END-REGEXP a regular expression to match the end of a token, by default this is \"\\_>\"."
