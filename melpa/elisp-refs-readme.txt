elisp-refs.el is an Emacs package for finding references to
functions, macros or variables. Unlike a dumb text search,
elisp-refs.el actually parses the code, so it's never confused by
comments or `foo-bar' matching `foo'.

See https://github.com/Wilfred/refs.el/blob/master/README.md for
more information.
