The idea is to let you create notes that are kept in sync when you scroll through the
document, but that are external to it - the notes themselves live in an Org-mode file. As
such, this leverages the power of Org-mode (the notes may have outlines, latex fragments,
babel, etc...) while acting like notes that are made /in/ the document.

Also, I must thank Sebastian for the original idea and inspiration!
