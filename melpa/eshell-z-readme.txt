`eshell-z.el' is an Emacs port of z(1) <https://github.com/rupa/z>.

It keeps track of where you have been and how many commands you invoke there,
and provides a convenient way to jump to the directories you actually
use.

`eshell-z.el' and z(1) can work together by sharing the same data file.

Usage:

 ~ $ z -h
 usage: z [-chlrtx] [regex1 regex2 ... regexn]

     -c, --current        estrict matches to subdirectories of the current directory
     -h, --help           show a brief help message
     -l, --list           list only
     -r, --rank           match by rank only
     -t, --time           match by recent access only
     -x, --delete         remove the current directory from the datafile

 examples:

     z foo         cd to most frecent dir matching foo
     z foo bar     cd to most frecent dir matching foo, then bar
     z -r foo      cd to highest ranked dir matching foo
     z -t foo      cd to most recently accessed dir matching foo
     z -l foo      list all dirs matching foo (by frecency)
