;; An easy way to write Linux kernel or QEMU code
;; according to the style guidelines.

;; Enable this checker by adding code like the following
;; to your startup files:

;;     (eval-after-load 'flycheck
;;       '(flycheck-checkpatch-setup))

;;;; Code:

(require 'flycheck)

(defvar flycheck-checkpatch-scripts-directory "scripts")

(defun flycheck-checkpatch-scripts-directory (&optional checker)
  (and (buffer-file-name)
       (locate-dominating-file (buffer-file-name)
                               flycheck-checkpatch-scripts-directory)))

(defun flycheck-checkpatch-set-executable ()
  (when-let ((directory (flycheck-checkpatch-scripts-directory)))
    (setq-local flycheck-checkpatch-executable
		(concat directory flycheck-checkpatch-scripts-directory "/checkpatch.pl"))))
