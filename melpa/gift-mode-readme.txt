A major mode for editing quiz questions in GIFT format.

GIFT format is an import format for quiz questions in the Moodle
virtual learning environment, supporting multiple-choice,
true-false, short answer, matching missing word, and numerical
questions.

This mode provides syntax highlighting and editing commands to make
rapid viewing and modification of large numbers of questions
easier.
