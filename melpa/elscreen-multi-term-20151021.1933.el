;;; Commentary:

;; This makes elscreen can manage multi term buffer each screen.
;;
;; To use this, add the following line somewhere in your init file:
;; ;; When you use this with elscreen-separate-buffer-list, you need to
;; ;; add this before (require 'elscreen-separate-buffer-list)
;;
;;      (require 'elscreen-multi-term)
;;
;; Function: emt-multi-term
;;   Create multi-term buffer related to screen.
;;   When the multi-term  buffer already exists, switch to the buffer.
;;
;; Function: emt-toggle-multi-term
;;   Toggle between current buffer and the multi-term buffer.
;;
;; Function: emt-pop-multi-term
;;   Pop to the multi-term buffer.
