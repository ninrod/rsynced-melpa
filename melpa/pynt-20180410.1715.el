;; Author: Edward Banner <edward.banner@gmail.com>
;; Version: 1.0
;; Package-Version: 20180410.1715
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.4") (ein "0.13.1") (epc "0.1.1") (deferred "0.5.1"))

;;; Commentary:

;; pynt is an Emacs minor mode for generating and interacting with EIN notebooks.
;;
;; Feature List
;; ------------
;; - On-the-fly notebook creation
;;   - Run the command `pynt-mode' on a python buffer and a new notebook will be created for you to interact with (provided you have set the variable `pynt-start-jupyter-server-on-startup' to t)
;; - Dump a region of python code into a EIN notebook
;;   - Selectable regions include functions, methods, and code at the module level (i.e. outside of any function or class)
;; - Scroll the resulting EIN notebook with the code buffer
;;   - Alignment between code and cells are preserved even when cells are added and deleted
