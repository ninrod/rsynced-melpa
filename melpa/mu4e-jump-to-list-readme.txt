`mu4e-jump-to-list' allows to select and view mailing lists
automatically using existing List-ID headers in your mu database.

`mu4e-jump-to-list' is bound to "l" by default in both the mu4e main
and header views and shows active lists in recency order by default,
with lists with new messages first.

`mu4e-jump-to-list' integrates with `mu4e-query-fragments' when
installed, allowing the use of query fragments in all filter
definitions.
