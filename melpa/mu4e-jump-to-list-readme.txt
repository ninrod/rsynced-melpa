`mu4e-jump-to-list' allows to select and view mailing lists
automatically using existing List-ID headers in your mu database.

Just press "l" in the headers view and any mailing list you've
subscribed to will be automatically discovered and presented in
recency order. No setup or refiling necessary.

`mu4e-jump-to-list' integrates with `mu4e-query-fragments' when
installed, allowing the use of query fragments in all filter
definitions.
