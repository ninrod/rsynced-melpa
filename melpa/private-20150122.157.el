;;; Commentary:

;; Why do I need this?
;;
;; Sometimes you have need to sync private emacs configuration files
;; between different PCs. These normally include corporation project
;; configuration, corporation code, personal project code, etc.
;;
;; How private works?
;;
;; Private works by encrypt private configuration files with a password
;; you specified.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Put every private configuration into a private configuration directory
;; default to '~/.emacs.d/private'.
;; and make git ignoring this directory.
;; (private-require &optional package)
;; This function requires all your private configuration files.
;; If package name is specified, require just that package.
;; (private-find-configuration-file)
;; This function creates or visits a private configuration file.
;; (private-backup)
;; This function backups all your private configuration files.
;; So it's safe to put any private project related configuraiton on the
;; public git repo.
;; (private-recover)
;; This function recovers all your private configuration files.
;; (private-clear-backup)
;; This function removes all your private configuration backup files.
