This packages provides commands for operating on visible links with avy. It
is inspired by link hinting from vim-like browsers and browser plugins such
as pentadactyl. For example, `link-hint-open-link' will use avy to select and
open a visible link. A link is not limited to a url but can also be a file
link, button, org link, info link, help link, mu4e attachment, mailto
address, etc. Commands are also provided for copying links to the kill ring
(and optionally the clipboard and/or primary) and for opening multiple links
at once like with pentadactyl's "g;" or qutebrowser's "--rapid" flag. It is
possible for the user to add both new link types and new link actions.

For more information, see the link-hint.el README/documentation.
