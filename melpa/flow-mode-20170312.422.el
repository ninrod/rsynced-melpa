;;; Commentary:

;; Minor mode for flowtype.org, derived from web-mode.  Essentially a
;; rewrite of an official flow-for-emacs snippet into a standalone
;; mode with an improved usability.
;;
;; To enable this mode, enable it in your preferred javascript mode's
;; hooks:
;;
;;   (add-hook 'js2-mode-hook 'flow-enable-automatically)
;;
;; This will enable flow-minor-mode for a file only when there is a
;; "// @flow" declaration at the first line and a `.flowconfig` file
;; is present in the project. If you wish to enable flow-minor-mode
;; for all javascript files, use this instead:
;;
;;  (add-hook 'js2-hook 'flow-minor-mode)
;;
