Manage external services from within Emacs.

Defining services:

A minimal example to define a service with `honcho-define-service`

    (honcho-define-service python-server
      :command ("python" "-m" "http.server"))

To list the services, use `M-x honcho'.  There is also `M-x honcho-procfile' to
load services from a Procfile.

    (honcho-define-service node-server
      :command ("node" "server.js")
      :cwd     "/path/to/project/"
      :env     (("NODE_ENV"  . "development")
                ("REDIS_URL" . "redis://localhost:6379/0")))

Troubleshooting:

+ **The service buffer contains ANSI control sequences**

  `honcho' uses `compilation-mode' underneath, it's recommended to setup
  [xterm-color][] for `compilation-mode'.
