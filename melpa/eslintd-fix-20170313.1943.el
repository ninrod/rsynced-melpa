;; Version: 1.0.0

;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the eslintd-fix minor mode, which will use eslint_d
;; (https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js) to automatically fix javascript code
;; before it is saved.

;; To use it, require it, make sure `eslint_d' is in your path and add it to
;; your favorite javascript mode:

;;    (add-hook 'js2-mode-hook #'eslintd-fix-mode)
