;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides ‘elpa-deploy’: a complement to the function
;; ‘package-upload-file’ from ‘package-x.el’, which automatizes the
;; deployment of simple and multi-file packages.  This function
;; automatizes the upload of a library to an ELPA directory so that no
;; other action is needed.  Particularly useful for rapid ELPA
;; deployment aiding testing and releases.  The procedures
;; automatically taken care of consist of updating the version field
;; of a package source using the current time-stamp, generating its
;; tar archive if multi-file, and uploading the results to a specified
;; ELPA directory, while deleting any previous version of the same
;; package already deployed.

  "Deploy simple or multi-file package.
PATH is the filename of a single ‘.el’ file (simple package) or a
directory containing a ‘*-pkg.el’ file (multi-file package).
UPLOAD-BASE is the target ELPA directory.

This function updates the version field of the package source
in-place -- using the current timestamp, then it generates its
tar archive (in the multi-file case), *deletes* any previously
deployed version of the same package in UPLOAD-BASE and finally
uploads the result.

See ‘package-archive-upload-base’ for the exact meaning of
UPLOAD-BASE."
