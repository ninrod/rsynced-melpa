Transliterate Unicode characters into one of 128 ASCII characters.

Two functions are provided that operate on strings (`unidecode' and
`unidecode-sanitize'), plus two that operate on buffer regions
(`unidecode-region' and `unidecode-sanitize-region')

This package is an Emacs Lisp port of the Unidecode package for Python:
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Unidecode/>.
