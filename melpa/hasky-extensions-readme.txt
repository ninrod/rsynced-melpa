The package provides a way to add and remove Haskell language extensions
easily from any place in a file without moving the point.  This is done
with help of a menu where the most popular language extensions are
assigned just one letter to toggle, while the others require two key
strokes.

Naturally, when performing toggling of the extensions, they are kept
sorted and aligned automatically for you.
