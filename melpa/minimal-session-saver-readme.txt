Quickstart

    (require 'minimal-session-saver)

    (minimal-session-saver-install-aliases)

    M-x mss-store RET

    ;; quit and restart Emacs

    M-x mss-load RET

Explanation

The only information stored by this library is a list of visited
files.  Not window configuration, nor point position.

Giving a universal prefix argument to any of the interactive
session-management commands causes a prompt for the session-state
file location, allowing minimal-session-saver to be used as a
(very) minimal project manager.

When frame-bufs.el is present, the session associated with a
particular frame can be stored and recovered.

To use minimal-session-saver, place the minimal-session-saver.el
library somewhere Emacs can find it, and add the following to your
~/.emacs file:

    (require 'minimal-session-saver)

Several interactive commands are provided to manage sessions:

    minimal-session-saver-store
    minimal-session-saver-load
    minimal-session-saver-store-frame         ; requires frame-bufs.el
    minimal-session-saver-load-frame          ; requires frame-bufs.el
    minimal-session-saver-add-buffer
    minimal-session-saver-remove-buffer
    minimal-session-saver-mark-stored-buffers

without keybindings.

An additional command

    minimal-session-saver-install-aliases

installs shorter command aliases for the above, and can
be run at autoload-time through a setting in customize.
