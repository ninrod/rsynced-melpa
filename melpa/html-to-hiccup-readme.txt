There is a single interactive command, `html-to-hiccup-convert-region',
which parses the current region as HTML, and replaces it with the
equivalent Hiccup.  This is especially useful when doing Clojure
development and copying HTML snippets from the web.

This package does not contain any keybindings, bind it to whatever you see
fit.

Goes well with `cider-format-edn-region', or with fresh lemonade.
