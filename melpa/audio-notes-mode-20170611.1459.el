;;; Commentary:
;;
;; `audio-notes-mode' is a way to manage small audio recordings that
;; you make in order to record thoughts.
;;
;; After much struggle, I finally decided to stop trying to make
;; speech recognition work from my phone. Instead, I decided to just
;; record audio notes, and I wrote this package to automate the
;; process of playing them back at the computer.
;;
;; I found this to be even faster, because I don't have to wait and
;; see if the speech recognition worked and I don't have to repeat the
;; message 1/3 of the time.
;;
;; A tasker profile (which records and uploads these notes) is also
;; provided at the github page.
;;
;; The idea is that you sync voice notes you record on your
;; smartphone into a directory on your PC. But you're free to use it
;; in other ways.
;;
;; When you activate this mode, it will play the first audio note in a
;; specific directory and wait for you to write it down. Once you're
;; finished, just call the next note with \\[anm/play-next]. When you
;; do this, `audio-notes-mode' will DELETE the note which was already
;; played and start playing the next one. Once you've gone through all
;; of them, `audio-notes-mode' deactivates itself.

;;; Instructions:
;;
;; INSTALLATION
;;
;; Configuration is simple. Require the package and define the following two variables:
;;           (require 'audio-notes-mode)
;;           (setq anm/notes-directory "~/Directory/where/your/notes/are/")
;;           (setq anm/goto-file "~/path/to/file.org") ;File in which you'll write your notes as they are played.
;;
;; Then just choose how you want to activate it.
;; 1) If you use `org-mobile-pull', you can do
;;       (setq anm/hook-into-org-pull t)
;;    and `audio-notes-mode' will activate whenever you call
;;    org-mobile-pull.
;;    
;; 2) The second options is to just bind `audio-notes-mode' to
;;    some key and call it when you want.
;;       (global-set-key [f8] 'audio-notes-mode)
;;
;; If you installed manually, first require the feature with:
;; then use one of the methods above.
