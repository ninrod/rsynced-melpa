;;; Commentary:

;; This package allows an Emacs user to create, delete, rename and fast swtich
;; between multiple inferior shells using the buffer-manager library.  This is
;; done by extending the `buffer-manage` and using its functions and
;; keybindings to manage multiple inferior shells.  To summarize, this
;; includes:
;; * A major mode for switching to, deleting and starting new shells.
;; * Fast switching with customized key bindings through the customize
;;   framework.
;; * Track and rename shells by name through the shell entry management mode.
;; * Interact with buffer shell (entries) as objects with a straight forward
;;   API.

;;; Usage:

;; You can start a new shell with `C-x C-h`.  Do this again to get another
;; shell that lives as a *separate* process in a buffer.  Use `C-tab` to get a
;; list of shells in the *Entries* buffer where you can rename, delete, switch
;; or add new shells.  To "fast" switch use `C-x C-h`, which changes the
;; current window's shell to the last used or next shell based on the current
;; cycling method.
