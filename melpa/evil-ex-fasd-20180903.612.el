;;  Invoke fasd functionality right from `evil-ex'

;;; Code:

(require 'evil)
(require 'fasd)

(defvar evil-ex-fasd-prefix ":"
  "Prefix for ‘evil-ex’ command that will invoke fasd.")

(defun evil-ex-fasd-eval (orig-fun str)
  "Advice for ‘evil-ex-execute’. ORIG-FUN is `evil-ex-execute', STR is the command input."
  (if (not (cond
            ((string-prefix-p evil-ex-fasd-prefix str)
             (funcall #'fasd-find-file t (string-remove-prefix evil-ex-fasd-prefix str)))))
      (funcall orig-fun str)))

(advice-add #'evil-ex-execute :around 'evil-ex-fasd-eval)

;;;###autoload
(defun evil-ex-fasd ()
  "Invoke `evil-ex' with `evil-ex-fasd-prefix'."
  (interactive)
  (evil-ex evil-ex-fasd-prefix))

(provide 'evil-ex-fasd)
;;; evil-ex-fasd.el ends here
