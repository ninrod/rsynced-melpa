;;; org-make-toc.el --- Automatic tables of contents for Org files  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2018 Adam Porter

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; URL: http://github.com/alphapapa/org-make-toc
;; Package-Version: 20180603.0
;; Version: 0.1-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "25.1") (dash "2.12") (s "1.10.0") (org "9.0"))
;; Keywords: Org, convenience

;;; Commentary:

;; This package makes it easy to have a customizable table of contents in Org files that can be
;; updated manually, or automatically when the file is saved.  Links to headings are created
;; compatible with GitHub's Org renderer.

;;;; Installation

;; Install the packages `dash' and `s'.  Then put this file in your `load-path', and put this in
;; your init file:

;; (require 'org-make-toc)

;;;; Usage

;; 1.  Make a heading in the Org file where you want the table of contents, and give it the Org
;; property "TOC" with the value "this".

;; 2.  Run the command `org-make-toc'.

;;;;; Customization

;; The table of contents can be customized by setting the "TOC" property of headings:

;; +  Set to "ignore" to omit a heading from the TOC.
;; +  Set to "ignore-children" or "0" to omit a heading's child headings from the TOC.
;; +  Set to a number N to include child headings no more than N levels deep in the TOC.

;;;;; Automatically update on save

;; To automatically update a file's TOC when the file is saved, use the command
;; `add-file-local-variable' to add `org-make-toc' to the Org file's `before-save-hook'.
