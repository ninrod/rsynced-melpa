A tool to quickly open a daily diary buffer.

Morning Pages are a concept named by Julia Cameron in her book
"The Artist's Way".  They are defined by the activity of waking up every
day and writing three pages of anything or everything that might be on
your mind.  The purpose is to express one's most urgent thoughts in a slightly
more coherent manner than they tend to occur in the realm of pure thought.
Unlike a "diary" they are meant to be a dumping ground, not a saving place.
Think it, write it, clear your mind, and move on.  Just doing that is enough.
In my experience of doing it daily I fret less about silly things and work
through my issues more productively.  I recommend it highly.

Opening up Emacs and running `M-x mpages' will open up an empty buffer
pointed at a txt file for today.  As you type it will keep track of the time
spent and the number of words typed.  The default, 750  words approximates
three written pages.  A competent typist, just letting his or her thoughts
flow should be able to finish between 15 and 20 minutes.  I find the effort
required is absolutely worth the time spent.  Enough so that I made this
package.  `M-x customize' has a few mpages related options under Text->mpages.
