;; Explanation
;;
;; Vector-utils is a collection of functions for vector manipulation.
;; This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful for
;; programming in Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; Furthermore (when programming in Emacs Lisp), be aware that the
;; modification of a vector is not permitted: only vector *elements*
;; may be changed.  All "modification" operations herein can only
;; work by making copies, which is not efficient.
;;
;; The following functions are provided:
;;
;;     `vector-utils-depth'
;;     `vector-utils-flatten'
;;     `vector-utils-insert-before'
;;     `vector-utils-insert-after'
;;     `vector-utils-insert-before-pos'
;;     `vector-utils-insert-after-pos'
;;
;; To use vector-utils, place the vector-utils.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'vector-utils)
