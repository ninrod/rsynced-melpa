The dart-mode that exists doesn't properly indent, so give this a try.

Much of this mode is derived from the js.el package.

General Remarks:

XXX: This mode assumes that block comments are not nested inside block
XXX: comments

Exported names start with "pickle-"; private names start with
"pickle--".
