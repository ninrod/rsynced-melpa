;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a minimal interface to the SoundCloud API, allowing
;; the user to find tracks by a specified artist or an artist found through
;; search.  Tracks are played using EMMS, which must be configured to play
;; streams from URLs.  mplayer is recommended for this.
