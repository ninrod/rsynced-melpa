;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; memolist.el is Emacs port of memolist.vim. Org-mode is very useful and multifunction,
;; but it is also hard to approach and coufuse with markdown. memolist.el offer you
;; simple interface for writing and searching.
;; 
;; This program make markdown file in your `memolist-memo-directory' or
;; search markdown file there. By default, `memolist-memo-directory' is
;; set to "~/Memo" directory. If you would like to change it,
;; use custom-set-valiables function like this.
;; 
;; (custom-set-variables '(memolist-memo-directory "/path/to/your/memo/directory"))
;; 
;; Commands:
;; `memolist-show-list': Show markdown file which placed in `memolist-memo-directory'.
;; `memolist-memo-grep': Search contents of markdown file by arg.
;; `memolist-memo-grep-tag': Search tags in markdown file by arg.
;; `memolist-memo-new': Create new markdown file in `memolist-memo-directory'.
