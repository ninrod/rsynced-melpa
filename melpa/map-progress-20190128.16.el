;;; Commentary:

;; This package defines mapping macros that report progress.

;; For many of the standard and CL mapping functions like `mapc' macros
;; like `mapc-with-progress-reporter' are defined here.  The arguments
;; have the same meaning as the respective arguments of the mapping
;; function or of `make-progress-reporter', which ever has an argument by
;; the same name.

;; Even when the original mapping function supports multiple sequences the
;; macros defined here only support one.  All of `make-progress-reporter's
;; arguments except for MESSAGE are optional.  This includes the starting
;; and final state arguments.

;; All standard mapping function with exactly two mandatory arguments that
;; call the function applied to each element with exactly one argument are
;; supported by `map-with-progress-reporter', which can be used when no
;; progress reporting variant of that function has been defined here.  But
;; any optional arguments the original might have are not supported.
