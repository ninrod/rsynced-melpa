Quickstart

    (require 'ido-load-library)
    M-x ido-load-library RET

Explanation

Ido-load-library is an alternative to `load-library' which
uses `ido-completing-read' for completion against all
available libraries in your `load-path'.

To use ido-load-library, place the ido-load-library.el file
somewhere Emacs can find it, and add the following to your
~/.emacs file:

    (require 'ido-load-library)

The interactive command `ido-load-library' is provided, though
not bound to any key.  It can be executed via

    M-x ido-load-library

or bound via something like

    (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c l") 'ido-load-library)

or safely aliased to `load-library'

    (defalias 'load-library 'ido-load-library)

The interactive command `ido-load-library-find' is also
provided.  Like `ido-load-library', it searches your
`load-path', but instead of loading the selected library,
it visits the file in a buffer.

    M-x customize-group RET ido-load-library RET
    M-x customize-group RET ido RET

Notes

    Defines the variable `library-name-history' outside of the
    `ido-load-library-' namespace.

Bugs

    When invalidating the disk cache, `ido-load-library' only checks
    whether `load-path' has changed, not whether new files were added
    to existing paths.  Workarounds:

        1. Install libraries using ELPA/package.el, in which case this
           assumption always works.
        2. Wait for the cache to expire (7 days).
        3. Give universal prefix argument to `ido-load-library'
           to force invalidation of the cache.

    Should not remove -autoloads and -pkg library names unless there
    is another name found with the same base.
