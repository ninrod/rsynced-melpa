,  This file is part of the emagicians starter kit, which is available
,  here: https://github.com/jonnay/emagicians-starter-kit
,
,  Note that if you are using this .el file, you probably aren't using
,  the emagicians sarter kit, which is fine. You dont need this for
,  that.

* Motivation

,  I used to type 'necessary' wrong... ALL THE TIME. I misspelled it so
,  often that it became part of my muscle memory.  It is one of *THOSE*
,  words for me.  There are others, that by muscle, or brain memory,
,  are "burned in" as a particular pattern.
,
,  This is an attempt to break that pattern, by forcing you to re-type
,  your misspelled words 3 times.  This should help overcome any broken
,  muscle and brain memory.
