Org-evil provides integration between Evil and Org through
various means such as contextual keybindings.

Org-evil has a standard set of keybindings, with additional
bindings that vary depending on the location and type of
Org file being edited, for example some bindings are only
active within a table.

All the bindings aim to be fairly intuitive for Evil users,
so there shouldn't be any huge surprises.

For more information see the README.
