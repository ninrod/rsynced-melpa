This package provides convenient wrappers for more succinctly defining
keybindings. It allows defining multiple keys at once, specifying an
arbitrary number of named prefix keys to be used in key definitions,
implicitly wrapping key strings with (kbd ...), and more. It provides a
single function for standard emacs key definitions as well as evil key
definitions for any evil state and any keymap. It also provides a setup
function to generate "nmap", "vmap", etc. keybinding functions for evil.

For more information see the README in the online repository.
