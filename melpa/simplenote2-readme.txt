This is a new version of simplenote.el which assists the interaction with
Simplenote (http://app.simplenote.com/).  The major improvement points from
the original version are

* Use of Simplenote API ver.2 to interact with server which can provide the
  support of tags, automatic merge of notes, and some other features.
* Asynchronous and concurrent access to server which brings faster sync of
  notes and non-blocking UI.
