;;; Commentary:

;; Provides language support for Yu-Gi-Oh! deck files.  These typically have a
;; ".ydk" extension.  They are used in YGOPro and other dueling simulators.

;; YDK files consist of lists of newline-delimited integers.  These integers
;; correspond to the 8-digit "passcodes" unique to each card. (See
;; http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Passcode for details.)  Each newline-delimited
;; integer represents one copy of a corresponding card in a deck.

;; Comments may appear anywhere in a file, starting with "#" or "!", followed by
;; (usually) arbitrary characters, ending with a newline.

;; There are three "magic" comments which typically denote the beginning of a
;; new deck (that is, the Main Deck, Extra Deck or Side Deck).  Conventionally,
;; these magic comments are of the forms:

;;     #main
;;     #extra
;;     !side

;; The magic comments are highlighted specially in this mode to make them more
;; distinguishable.

;; Putting it all together, a YDK file specifying a deck,

;; - created by someone named Jackson
;; - with the following cards in his Main Deck:
;;   - 3x Blue-Eyes White Dragon
;;   - 1x Lord of D.
;;   - 1x The Flute of Summoning Dragon
;; - and this card in his Extra Deck:
;;   - 1x Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon
;; - and this card in his Side Deck:
;;   - 1x Cipher Soldier

;; would look something like this:

;;     #created by Jackson
;;     #main
;;     89631139
;;     89631139
;;     89631139
;;     17985575
;;     43973174
;;     #extra
;;     23995346
;;     !side
;;     79853073

;; Also, YDK mode will calculate the total number of cards in the Main, Extra
;; and Side Decks (in that order), and display those totals in the modeline.
;; The above deck would have a modeline display of:

;;     (YDK[5/1/1])
