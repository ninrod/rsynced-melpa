This extension adds a command, `swift-helpful', which, when
executed, shows documentation about a Swift token under
point.  Sources of documentation include:

   - Swift official manual and reference manual (installed by this
   extension in GNU Info format).

   - Language Server Protocol (LSP), if configured for the project.

   - Swift standard library source code (if available locally and
   its path is correctly configured).
