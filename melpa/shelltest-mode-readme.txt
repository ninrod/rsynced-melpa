Major mode for shelltestrunner (http://joyful.com/shelltestrunner).

Besides syntax highlighting, a few useful functions for dealing with
test files are provided:

To quickly open test files use `shelltest-find'.  To execute tests use
`shelltest-run' and `shelltest-run-all'.  These functions work from
all modes and can be bound to keys for convenience.

To find out how to customize (among other things) the location of the
test files, refer to the documentation of the relevant functions.
