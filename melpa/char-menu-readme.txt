This package allows to insert arbitrary symbols in Emacs in a very
efficient and straightforward way.  Whether you ever need to insert only
a couple of proper punctuation symbols or you're a Unicode geek who likes
all sorts of arrows and fancy math symbols, this package may be of some
use.

Features:

* it allows you organize all symbols you ever need into a hierarchy you
  define;

* in that tree-like structure most frequently used commands will require
  only one key-press, while others may get dedicated section (for
  example, “arrows”) so you first select that section and then you choose
  a symbol in it;

* it makes sense to have paired characters in that menu, like “” (and for
  that matter arbitrary combinations of symbols);

* however insertion of paired characters will place the point between
  them;

* …and if you insert paired characters while some text is selected, they
  will wrap it.
