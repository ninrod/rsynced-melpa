About

I made this theme because I liked the colors in ample theme but
didn't like how much gray there was. So I started with a few tweaks
here and there until it ended up looking quite a bit different, and
this is the result. The theme is being worked on actively and I add
new faces all the time.

Installing:

See README.md for the most current installation instructions.

Notes:

When trying to follow the 80-column line rule, I didn't split up
the face definitions - having, for example, the foreground and
background definitions on the same line makes it easier to search
for lines which contain a particular foreground/background combo
