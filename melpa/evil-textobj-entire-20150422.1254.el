;;; Commentary:

;; This is the textobj plugin for evil, to treat entire the buffer.
;; You can define keymaps like following:
;; (define-key evil-outer-text-objects-map evil-textobj-entire-key 'evil-entire-entire-buffer)
;; (define-key evil-inner-text-objects-map evil-textobj-entire-key 'evil-entire-entire-buffer)

;;; Code:

(require 'evil)

(defgroup evil-textobj-entire nil
  "Text object entire buffer for Evil"
  :prefix "evil-textobj-entire-"
  :group 'evil)

(defcustom evil-textobj-entire-key "e"
  "Key for evil-textobj-entire"
  :type 'string
  :group 'evil-textobj-entire)

(evil-define-text-object evil-entire-entire-buffer (count &optional beg end type)
  "Select entire buffer"
  (evil-range (point-min) (point-max)))

(provide 'evil-textobj-entire)
;;; evil-textobj-entire.el ends here
