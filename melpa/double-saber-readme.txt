A minor mode for filtering search buffer output.

With double-saber-mode enabled, use "d" to delete words and "x" to narrow.

Installation:
To load this file, add (require 'double-saber) to your init file.

You can configure double-saber for different modes using
double-saber-mode-setup. The following is an example for ripgrep.

(add-hook 'ripgrep-search-mode-hook
         (lambda ()
           (double-saber-mode)
           (setq-local double-saber-start-line 5)
           (setq-local double-saber-end-text "Ripgrep finished")))

Setting the start line and end text prevents useful text at those locations
from getting deleted.
