fingers-mode is a global minor mode that introduces key bindings for
navigation and text manipulation. It relies on modal editing to reduce the
usage of modifiers like Control and Meta. It introduces a new keymap to
trigger commands without the need for modifiers and can easily be toggled to
fall back to inserting text as usually in Emacs.
