;; Description:
;;
;; This adds an ivy-based interface to some of the features of ycmd. For
;; instance, it lets you access references to a name through ivy.

;;; Code:

(require 'ivy)
(require 'ycmd)

(defun ivy-ycmd--handle-selection (selection)
  "Jump to the file/line indicated by SELECTION."
  (with-ivy-window
    (save-match-data
      (let* ((loc-data (cdr selection))
             (filename (cdr (assq 'filepath loc-data)))
             (line-number (cdr (assq 'line_num loc-data))))
        (find-file filename)
        (widen)
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (forward-line (- line-number 1))))))

(defun ivy-ycmd--make-selection-entry (location)
  "Create an ivy selection entry from LOCATION.

The entry will be a cons-sell with a display-string as the car
and LOCATION as the cdr."
  (cons (make-symbol
         (format "%s:%s\t%s"
                 (cdr (assq 'filepath location))
                 (cdr (assq 'line_num location))
                 (cdr (assq 'description location))))
        location))

(defun ivy-ycmd--handle-response (response)
  "List the file locations in RESPONSE with ivy."
  (ivy-read "Goto: "
            (mapcar #'ivy-ycmd--make-selection-entry response)
            :action #'ivy-ycmd--handle-selection
            :caller 'ivy-ycmd))

;;;###autoload
(defun ivy-ycmd-goto-references ()
  "Jump to a reference to the symbol at the current point.

This finds all references to the symbol at point, lists them with
ivy, and jumps to the one selected by the user."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (--when-let (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'symbol)
      (goto-char (car it)))
    (ycmd--run-completer-command "GoToReferences"
      #'ivy-ycmd--handle-response)))
