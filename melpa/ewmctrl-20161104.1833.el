;;; Commentary:

;; `ewmctrl' provides an Emacs interface to the `wmctrl' command-line window-management program.

;; ## Table of Contents

;; - [Installation](#installation)
;; - [Usage](#usage)
;; - [Issues](#issues)
;; - [License](#license)

;; ## Installation

;; Install [ewmctrl from MELPA](http://melpa.org/#/ewmctrl), or put `ewmctrl.el' in your load-path and do a `(require 'ewmctrl)'.

;; ## Usage

;; Create an `ewmctrl' buffer with `M-x ewmctrl'.

;; The default keybindings are:

;; ### Window actions

;; * RET - Switch to the selected desktop window (`ewmctrl-focus-window').

;; * D - Delete the selected desktop window (`ewmctrl-delete-window').

;; * I - Change the icon name of the selected desktop window (`ewmctrl-change-window-icon-name').

;; * m - Move the selected desktop window to a different desktop (`ewmctrl-move-window-to-other-desktop').

;; * M - Move the selected desktop window to the current desktop, raise it, and give it focus (`ewmctrl-move-window-to-current-desktop-and-focus').

;; * N - Change the name of the selected desktop window (`ewmctrl-change-window-name').

;; * r - Resize the selected desktop window by specifying dimensions in the minibuffer (`ewmctrl-resize-window'). Whilst in the minibuffer, use TAB and S-TAB to move within and between the width and height fields, and use C-RET to preview the currently specified dimensions.

;; * SPC [key] [action] - Select window specified by [key] and perform [action] on it, where [action] is an action keybinding. For example, SPC a RET will switch to the desktop window designated by 'a', whilst SPC c D will delete the desktop window designated by 'c'.

;; ### Filtering

;; * fc - Remove all filtering (`ewmctrl-filters-clear').

;; * fd - Add a filter by desktop number (`ewmctrl-filter-by-desktop-number').

;; * fD - Remove all filtering by desktop number (`ewmctrl-filter-desktop-number-clear').

;; * fn - Add a filter by window name (`ewmctrl-filter-by-name').

;; * fN - Remove all filtering by window name (`ewmctrl-filter-name-clear').

;; * fp - Add a filter by PID (`ewmctrl-filter-by-pid').

;; * fP - Remove all filtering by PID (`ewmctrl-filter-pid-clear').

;; ### Sorting

;; * Sd - Sort the list of desktop windows numerically by desktop number (`ewmctrl-sort-by-desktop-number').

;; * SD - Sort the list of desktop windows reverse-numerically by desktop number (`ewmctrl-sort-by-desktop-number-reversed').

;; * Sn - Sort the list of desktop windows lexicographically by name (`ewmctrl-sort-by-name').

;; * SN - Sort the list of desktop windows reverse-lexicographically by name (`ewmctrl-sort-by-name-reversed').

;; * Sp - Sort the list of desktop windows numerically by PID (`ewmctrl-sort-by-pid').

;; * SP - Sort the list of desktop windows reverse-numercially by PID (`ewmctrl-sort-by-pid-reversed').

;; ### General

;; * g - Refresh the list of desktop windows (`ewmctrl-refresh').

;; * n - Move point to next line (`next-line').

;; * p - Move point to previous line (`previous-line').

;; * ; - Toggle single-key-to-focus (`ewmctrl-toggle-single-key-to-focus'). When enabled, a desktop window can be focused simply by pressing the designated key for that window.

;; Customisation options are available via the `ewmctrl' customize-group.

;; ## Issues / bugs

;; Deletion of windows does not work in i3 4.8 and earlier due to [i3 bug #1396](http://bugs.i3wm.org/query/ticket/1396).

;; If you discover an issue or bug in `ewmctrl' not already noted:

;; * as a TODO item, or

;; * in [the project's "Issues" section on GitHub](https://github.com/flexibeast/ewmctrl/issues),

;; please create a new issue with as much detail as possible, including:

;; * which version of Emacs you're running on which operating system, and

;; * how you installed `ewmctrl'.
