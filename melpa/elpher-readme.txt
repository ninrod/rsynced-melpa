Elpher aims to provide a practical and friendly gopher client
for GNU Emacs.  It supports:

- intuitive keyboard and mouse-driven browsing,
- out-of-the-box compatibility with evil-mode,
- clickable web and gopher links *in plain text*,
- caching of visited sites,
- pleasant and configurable colouring of Gopher directories,
- direct visualisation of image files,
- a simple bookmark management system,
- connections using TLS encryption,
- support for the fledgling Gemini protocol.

To launch Elpher, simply use 'M-x elpher'.  This will open a start
page containing information on key bindings and suggested starting
points for your gopher exploration.

Full instructions can be found in the Elpher info manual.

Elpher is under active development.  Any suggestions for
improvements are welcome, and can be made on the official
project page, gopher://thelambdalab.xyz/1/projects/elpher/.
