;;; Commentary:

;; This provides a single interactive command which will run the
;; shell command "drone exec".  This will look for a .drone.yml file
;; and run the command from this path.  The output of running the
;; tests will be displayed to the user.  Drone is an application that
;; runs your tests using docker, it can run both locally and on
;; drone.io server.

;;; Code:

(defun drone-root ()
  (or (locate-dominating-file default-directory ".drone.yml")
      (error "Missing .drone.yml not found in directory tree")))

;;;###autoload
(defun drone-exec ()
  "Run \"drone exec\" where .drone.yml is found."
  (interactive)
  (let ((default-directory (drone-root)))
    (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create (concat "*drone: " default-directory "*"))
      (compilation-start (format "drone exec")
                         nil
                         (lambda (_) (buffer-name))))))
