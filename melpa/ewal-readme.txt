A dependency-free, pywal-based, automatic, terminal-aware Emacs
color-picker and theme generator.

My hope is that `ewal' will remain theme agnostic, with people
contributing functions like `ewal-get-spacemacs-theme-colors' from
`ewal-spacemacs-themes' for other popular themes such as
`solarized-emacs' <https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs>,
making it easy to keep the style of different themes, while
adapting them to the rest of your theming setup.  No problem should
ever have to be solved twice!
