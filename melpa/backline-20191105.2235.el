;;; Commentary:

;; An outline heading does not extend to the right edge of the window
;; when its body is collapsed.  This is unfortunate when the used face
;; sets the background color or another property that is visible on
;; whitespace.  This package adds overlays to extend the appearance of
;; headings all the way to the right window edge.

;; Unlike `outline-mode', `outline-minor-mode' by itself does not
;; highlight headings.  The `outline-minor-faces' package implements
;; that and is required by this package.

;; Usage:
;;
;;   (use-package backline
;;     :after outline
;;     :config (advice-add 'outline-flag-region :after 'backline-update))

;;; Code:

(require 'outline)
(require 'outline-minor-faces)

;;;###autoload
(defun backline-update (from to _hide)
  "When hidings, add an overlay to extend header's appearance to window edge."
  ;; TODO Also support `outline-mode' and `org-mode'.
  (when outline-minor-mode
    ;; `outline-hide-sublevels' tries to hide this range, in which case
    ;; `outline-back-to-heading' somehow concludes that point is before
    ;; the first heading causing it to raise an error.  Luckily we don't
    ;; actually have to do anything for that range, so we can just skip
    ;; ahead to the calls that hide the subtrees individually.
