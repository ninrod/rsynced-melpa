A major mode for writing hledger journal files.  It generates some
useful reports along with some financial ratios that can help you
keep a check on your financial health.  This is an attempt to
organize personal finances for Emacs users.  If you don't like this,
try `ledger-mode'.

Note: You must have hledger installed to be able to create the
      reports: overall report, daily report, balancesheet, income
      statement, etc.
