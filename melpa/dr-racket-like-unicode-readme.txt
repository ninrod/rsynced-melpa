This is an implementation of DrRacket-style Unicode input.  The
difference between this and an Emacs input method is that an Emacs
input method attempts to transform text as it is typed, while this
minor mode simply provides a command that turns the current
TeX-syntax symbol into its Unicode equivalent.
