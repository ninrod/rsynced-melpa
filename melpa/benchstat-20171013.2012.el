;;; Commentary:

;; This package makes proper benchmark results analysis far easier by
;; leveraging benchstat utility.
;;
;; One can use this package instead of `benchmark-run-compiled'
;; and get the benefits of correct (statistically significant),
;; easy-to-read profile stats.
;;
;; In orded to use this, you need benchstat binary:
;; https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat
;;
;; For detailed documentation, please visit `benchstat.el'
;; github repository.
