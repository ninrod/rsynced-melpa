This package provides helper functions to use the command line
version of KDE Connect, a bridge between Android devices and
computers, without leaving the comfort of Emacs.  It requires KDE
Connect on your computer(s) and Android device(s).  KDE Connect
currently requires Linux on the desktop, but does not require
KDE.
