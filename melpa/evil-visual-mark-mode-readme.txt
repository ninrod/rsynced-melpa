evil-visual-mark-mode displays all the evil marks you have
registered on a buffer. The purpose of this extension is to enhance
the marks in a buffer, normally when you set a mark on a position
is because you figured you are going to come back later, also you
would like to track all your important functions without having to
follow each marker.
