A minor mode for displaying party parrot in the modeline and rotating words.

To load this file, add (require 'parrot) to your init file.  You can display
the party parrot in your modeline by adding (parrot-mode).

To get the parrot to rotate on new email messages in mu4e, add:
(add-hook 'mu4e-index-updated-hook #'parrot-start-animation)

This animation code is a heavily modified version of Jacek "TeMPOraL"
Zlydach's famous nyan-mode.  Check out his original work at
