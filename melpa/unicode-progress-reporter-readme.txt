Explanation

This is a trivial modification to Emacs' built-in progress
reporter to display spinners using Unicode characters.

To use unicode-progress-reporter, place the
unicode-progress-reporter.el library somewhere Emacs can
find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'unicode-progress-reporter)
    (unicode-progress-reporter-setup)

See Also

    M-x customize-group RET unicode-progress-reporter RET

Notes

    redefines `progress-reporter-do-update'

    alters private variable `progress-reporter--pulse-characters'
