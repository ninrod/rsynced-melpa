org-analyzer is a tool that extracts time tracking data from org files (time
data recording with `org-clock-in', those lines that start with "CLOCK:"). It
then creates an interactive visualization of that data â€” outside of Emacs(!).

In order to run the visualizer / parser you need to have java installed.

This Emacs package provides a simple way to start the visualizer via
`org-analyzer-start' and feed it the default org files.

See https://github.com/rksm/clj-org-analyzer for more information.
