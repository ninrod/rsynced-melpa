;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package lets you enable minor modes based on file name and
;; contents. To find the right modes, it checks filenames against
;; patterns in `auto-minor-mode-alist' and file contents against
;; `auto-minor-mode-magic-alist'. These work like the built-in Emacs
;; variables `auto-mode-alist' and `magic-mode-alist'.
;;
;; Unlike major modes, all matching minor modes are enabled, not only
;; the first match.
;;
;; A reason you might want to use it:
;;   (add-to-list 'auto-minor-mode-alist '("-theme\\.el\\'" . rainbow-mode))
;;
;; There's intentionally no equivalent of `interpreter-mode-alist'.
;; Interpreters should determine the major mode.  Relevant minor
;; modes can then be enabled by major mode hooks.
;;
;; Minor modes are set whenever `set-auto-mode', the built-in function
;; responsible for handling automatic major modes, is called.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)

;;;###autoload
(defvar auto-minor-mode-alist ()
  "Alist of filename patterns vs corresponding minor mode functions.

This is an equivalent of `auto-mode-alist', for minor modes.

Unlike `auto-mode-alist', matching always follows `case-fold-search'.")

;;;###autoload
(defvar auto-minor-mode-magic-alist ()
  "Alist of buffer beginnings vs corresponding minor mode functions.

This is an equivalent of `magic-mode-alist', for minor modes.

Magic minor modes are applied after `set-auto-mode' enables any
major mode, so it's possible to check for expected major modes in
match functions.

Unlike `magic-mode-alist', matching always follows `case-fold-search'.")
