Use M-x elcontext for on overview of all contexts. Within this overview
several hydras will guide through the API, press ? to open the help hydra.
Contexts can consist of name, location (only for macOS), timespan, directory,
and action. If a part of a context is omitted this part is always valid e.g.
no location means anywhere, no time means anytime. Each command is triggered
once per day.
