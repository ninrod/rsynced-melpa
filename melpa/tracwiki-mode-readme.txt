tracwiki-mode is a major mode for editing Trac-formatted text files
in GNU Emacs. tracwiki-mode is free software, licensed under the
GNU GPL.

Starting in version 0.2, I've pretty much just copypasta'ed most of
the original trac-wiki from Shun-ichi GOTO:
http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/EmacsWikiEditScript Future versions will
include better English, yet more controls, and better
customization. Seriously though, without Shun-ichi Goto's work,
none of this magic would exist.
