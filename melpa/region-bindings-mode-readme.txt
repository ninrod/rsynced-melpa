region is active. You can then add custom keybindings to the region
keymap, e.g. you could set "k" to call the command 'kill-region'

Installation:

Add this to your .emacs:

(add-to-list 'load-path "/folder/containing/file")
(require 'region-bindings-mode)
(region-bindings-mode-enable)

Alternatively, you can install this easily via MELPA through the
Emacs package manager. To add MELPA to the package archives:

(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
