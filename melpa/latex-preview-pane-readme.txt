latex-preview-pane is a minor mode for Emacs that enables you to preview your LaTeX files directly in Emacs.
It supports PDF previews, your choice of pdflatex or xelatex, and it highlights errors in your LaTeX buffer.

To enable, place the following in your .emacs file:

(latex-preview-pane-enable)

As an alternative, you may enable it on the fly with:

M-x latex-preview-pane-mode
