Reazon is an implmentation of the miniKanren language for Emacs. It
provides an interface for writing and running relational programs.
That interface consists of the following macros:

* reazon-defrel
* reazon-run*
* reazon-run
* reazon-fresh
* reazon-conde
* reazon-conj
* reazon-disj
* reazon-project

Besides these, there is a single primitive goal, reazon-==.
