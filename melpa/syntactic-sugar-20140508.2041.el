;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'syntactic-sugar)
;;
;;     (if t
;;         (then (message "true"))
;;       (else (message "false")))
;;
;;     (unwind-protect
;;         (protected
;;           (error "Error"))
;;       (unwind
;;         (message "cleanup")))
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; This library offers absolutely no functionality!  The following
;; macros are provided as synonyms for `progn':
;;
;;     `then'
;;     `else'
;;     `protected'
;;     `unwind'
;;
;; These macros can be used to clarify `if' or `unwind-protect' forms.
;;
;; Note that as synonyms for `progn', these forms have no useful
;; effects, and no additional syntax check is done, so nothing
;; prevents you from writing obfuscatory expressions such as
;;
;;     (if t (else 1) (then 2))      ; same as (if t (progn 1) (progn 2))
;;
;; or idiotic expressions such as
;;
;;     (if t
;;         (protected 1)
;;       (unwind 2))
;;
;; So, think of these macros as glorified comments.  And realize that
;; if you are tempted to use them, if in fact you have even read the
;; documentation to this point, you are hopelessly impure at heart.
;;
;; To use syntactic-sugar, place the syntactic-sugar.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'syntactic-sugar)
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET syntactic-sugar RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;; When this library is loaded, the provided forms are registered as
;; keywords in font-lock.  This may be disabled via customize.
;;
;; The included macros are intentionally not autoloaded, because they
;; are outside the package namespace.
