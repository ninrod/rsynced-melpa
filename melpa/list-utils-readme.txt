Quickstart

    (require 'list-utils)

    (list-utils-flatten '(1 2 (3 4 (5 6 7))))
    ;; '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)

    (list-utils-depth '(1 2 (3 4 (5 6 7))))
    ;; 3

    (let ((cyclic-list '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)))
      (nconc cyclic-list (cdr cyclic-list))
      (list-utils-make-linear-inplace cyclic-list))
    ;; '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)

    (list-utils-cyclic-p '(1 2 3))
    ;; nil

    (list-utils-plist-del '(:one 1 :two 2 :three 3) :two)
    ;; '(:one 1 :three 3)

Explanation

List-utils is a collection of functions for list manipulation.
This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful
for programming in Emacs Lisp.

Notable functionality includes

    * `list-utils-flatten', a robust list-flattener which handles
      cyclic lists, non-nil-terminated lists, and preserves nils
      when they are found as list elements.

    * `tconc', a simple data structure for efficiently appending
      to a list

The following functions are provided:

    `make-tconc'
    `tconc-p'
    `tconc-list'
    `tconc'
    `list-utils-cons-cell-p'
    `list-utils-cyclic-length'
    `list-utils-improper-p'
    `list-utils-make-proper-copy'
    `list-utils-make-proper-inplace'
    `list-utils-make-improper-copy'
    `list-utils-make-improper-inplace'
    `list-utils-linear-p'
    `list-utils-linear-subseq'
    `list-utils-cyclic-p'
    `list-utils-cyclic-subseq'
    `list-utils-make-linear-copy'
    `list-utils-make-linear-inplace'
    `list-utils-safe-length'
    `list-utils-safe-equal'
    `list-utils-depth'
    `list-utils-flat-length'
    `list-utils-flatten'
    `list-utils-alist-or-flat-length'
    `list-utils-alist-flatten'
    `list-utils-insert-before'
    `list-utils-insert-after'
    `list-utils-insert-before-pos'
    `list-utils-insert-after-pos'
    `list-utils-and'
    `list-utils-not'
    `list-utils-xor'
    `list-utils-uniq'
    `list-utils-dupes'
    `list-utils-singlets'
    `list-utils-partition-dupes'
    `list-utils-plist-reverse'
    `list-utils-plist-del'

To use list-utils, place the list-utils.el library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'list-utils)

Notes

    This library includes an implementation of the classic Lisp
    `tconc' which is outside the "list-utils-" namespace.

Bugs

TODO

    @@@ spin out hash-table tests into separate library

    test cyclic inputs to all
    test improper inputs to all
    test single-element lists as inputs to all
    test cyclic single-element lists as inputs to all

    should list-utils-make-improper-inplace accept nil as a special case?

    could do -copy/-inplace variants for more functions, consider doing
    so for flatten

    list* returns a non-list on single elt, our function throws an error
