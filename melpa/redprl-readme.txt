This is a major mode for editing RedPRL developments.  The current
editing features include simple syntax highlighting, imenu, and
completion support.  Additionally, there is a command to run RedPRL
in a compilation buffer.

RedPRL can be obtained from https://github.com/RedPRL/sml-redprl .

Make sure to set the variable `redprl-command' to the location of the
redprl binary.
