;;; Commentary:
;; Pushbullet is an android app that handles notifications. Luckily
;; there's an API which we can use to push stuff from your favourite
;; editor to your phone
;;
;; At the moment this uses `grapnel' library for http requests. This
;; is just an experiment, any comments and suggestions are more than
;; welcome. Customize the variable `pushbullet-api-key' in the group
;; `pushbullet' to match your api-key. At present calling
;; `pushbullet' interactively with a selection will send that
;; selection with the user specified title to your android app
;; if region is inactive it will send the whole contents of buffer
;; to the app

;;; History:

;; 0.5.0 - Initial release
;; 0.5.1 - Update api url to new api url
;;       - Fix wrong variable name `pb/api-key'
;; 0.5.2 - Remove existing use of shared devices due to new json schema
;;       - Remove usage of ht library as we dont use hash tables for now
