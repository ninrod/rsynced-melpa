;;; Commentary:

;; This mode allows to paste whole buffers or parts of buffers to
;; pastebin-like services.  It supports more than one service and will
;; failover if one service fails.  More services can easily be added
;; over time and prefered services can easily be configured.

:domain      URL that we should do the request to to paste data.
:type        HTTP Request type, defaults to POST.
:parser      Defines how request.el parses the result. Look up :parser for

:post-data   Default post fields sent to service. Defaults to nil.
:post-field  Name of the field to insert the code into.
:success     Callback sent to `request`, look up how to write these in the
             documentation for `request`"
