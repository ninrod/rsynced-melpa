Projectile has native support for using ivy as its completion
system.  Counsel-projectile provides further ivy integration into
projectile by taking advantage of ivy's mechanism to select from a
list of actions and/or apply an action without leaving the
comlpetion session.  It is inspired by helm-projectile.  See the
README for more details.
