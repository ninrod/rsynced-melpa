;;; Commentary:

;; This is a rewrite/overhaul of an existing package called elscreen-buffer-list,
;; fixed for emacs 24 and the latest version of elscreen from MELPA.
;;
;; Enabling this package gives each elscreen its own buffer group.
;; When a buffer is first displayed, it automatically gets added to the
;; group of the current elscreen. Then, while you're in that elscreen,
;; you'll only be able to see those buffers that belong to that elscreen.
;;
;; This works by hijacking some low-level buffer access functions, which
;; are the only functions (that I can find) that generate the master
;; list of buffers, at the lowest level. If you find a place where this
;; doesn't look, report it and I'm sure we can find a function to advise.
;;
;; In order to give you an "out" to see ALL the buffers in case you want to,
;; you can add a command name (a symbol) to 'elscreen-buffer-group-skip-commands and
;; elscreen-buffer-group will "skip" the filtering advice on that command. By default
;; this is set to just 'ibuffer, but you can make it whatever you want. All
;; other commands will use the filtered list.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; You have to be using elscreen, then just require it.
;;
;; (require 'elscreen)
;; (require 'elscreen-buffer-group)
;;
;; You can choose which commands do NOT filter the buffer list:
;;
;; (setq 'elscreen-buffer-group-skip-commands `(my-special-buffer-switching-command))
;;
;; You can turn on/off exclusivity, meaning a buffer can ONLY belong to one
;; screen at a time. If this is nil, a buffer can be in more than one screen.
;; If it's non-nil, adding a buffer to a screen (displaying it while in that
;; screen) will remove it from all other screens:
;;
;; (setq elscreen-buffer-group-exclusive nil)
;;
