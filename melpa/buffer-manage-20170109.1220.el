;;; Commentary:

;; Provides support to manage buffers of any kind.  This is helpful for using
;; multiple inferior shells, multiple SQL session buffers or any other piped
;; process that requires multiple buffers.

;; The library includes support for:
;; * A major mode and buffer for listing, switching, and organizing multiple Emacs
;;   buffers.
;; * Fast switching with customized key bindings through the customize framework.
;; * Switch between managers providing the same key bindings for buffer entries
;;   with the same key bindings for creation, switching and managing.
;; * Create your own trivial implementations in minimal set of Emacs Lisp code.
;; * Interact with buffer entries and manager as objects with a straight forward
;;   API.
