This package will let you edit a latex fragment like editing a src code
block.

Usage
=====

First, turn on `org-edit-latex-mode'. Then you can edit a LaTeX fragment just
as what you'll do to edit a src block.

Use `org-edit-special' to enter a dedicated LaTeX buffer.
Use `org-edit-src-exit' to exit LaTeX buffer when you finished editing.
Use `org-edit-src-abort' to quit editing without saving changes.

Note that all above commands are built-in Org commands, so your current
keybindings to them will do the job.
