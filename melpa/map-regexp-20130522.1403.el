;;; Commentary:

;; This library defines several forms that search forward from
;; point for a regular expression and call a function for each
;; match to do something with the match data.

;; Equivalents of `mapc', `mapcar', and `cl-mapcan' are defined.
;; Anaphoric variants that expect an expression instead of a function
;; are also available.  Instead an expression `mr-amapcar-regexp'
;; also accepts an integer (or list of integers); it then returns a
;; list of match strings (resp. a list of lists of match strings).

;; If that isn't enough use `mr-loop-regexp' which supports all of
;; `cl-loop's accumulation clauses.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)

;;; Loop

(defmacro mr-loop-regexp (regexp bound clause form)
  "Search forward from point for REGEXP evaluating FORM for each match.
For each match evaluate FORM, which has access to the match data.
Use the `cl-loop' accumulation CLAUSE to collect the results.

BOUND, if non-nil, bounds the search; it is a buffer position.
The match found must not extend after that position.

Also see `cl-loop', `re-search-forward', and `match-...'."
