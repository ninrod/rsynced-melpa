;; Package-Version: 20151105.228

;;; Commentary:

;; Adds to the modeline a wordcount, words per minute, and an estimate
;; of how long you will have to continue writing to meet the day's goal.

;; If you plan to use this with org-mode you should install the great
;; org-wc.el from https://github.com/dato/org-wc

;;; Code:

;; TODO: Perhaps make `nanowrimo-mode' hook into auto-fill-mode?  Then
;; it wouldn't be accurate after deletion...  But it might be faster.
