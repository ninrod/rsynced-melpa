;;; Commentary:

;; This is a full implementation of the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol[1] for Emacs. You
;; pass in a JSON string, Emacs executes the specified function(s), and a
;; JSON-RPC 2.0 response is returned.

;; It was originally part of Porthole, a full-fledged HTTP-based RPC server for
;; Emacs:

;; http://www.github.com/jcaw/porthole

;; The underlying JSON-RPC protocol was extracted into a separate package so
;; that it could serve as a framework on which other RPC servers could be built.

;; *No transport logic is included.* This package is designed to sit underneath
;; a transport layer, which is responsible for communicate with external
;; clients. Since JSON-RPC provides no inbuilt mechanism for authenticating
;; requests, the transport layer should also handle authentication.

;; Here's en example request:

;; {
;;   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
;;   "method": "insert",
;;   "params": ["some text to insert"],
;;   "id": "3140983184"
;; }

;; Pass this as a string to `json-rpc-server-handle' - the specified text will
;; be inserted and the return value of the call to `insert' will be encoded into
;; a response.

;; Symbols and keywords can be passed by abusing the JSON-RPC syntax as follows:

;; {
;;   "a symbol": "'a-symbol",
;;   "a keyword": ":a-keyword"
;; }

;; This is a simplified explanation of the package that glosses over a lot of
;; details. Please refer to the full README[3] for an up-to-date and thorough
;; explanation.

Parameters
----------

`REQUEST-IN-JSON' should be a JSON-RPC (up to 2.0) request,
encoded in a JSON string.

`EXPOSED-FUNCTIONS' should be a list of function symbols that are
exposed to RPC calls. The RPC call will only be executed if its
method is in this list.

  - Each function name should be a symbol.

  - Do not include raw functions such as lambdas.

  - Do not include string names.

Returns the JSON-RPC 2.0 response, encoded in a JSON string.

Description
-----------

This is the main entry point into the RPC layer. This is the
method that decodes the RPC request and executes it. This method
is transport-agnostic - transport has to be implemented
separately.

This method can take either a single encoded request, or an
encoded list of requests, per the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification.

Please note that this implementation deviates slightly from the
JSON-RPC 2.0 specification:

  1. Notifications are not supported. All RPC requests will
     receive a response. Notifications may be implemented above
     this layer, at the transport level.

  2. Batch requests are not processed concurrently. Batch
     requests will always be processed in the order they are
     supplied. Responses will be supplied in the same order."
