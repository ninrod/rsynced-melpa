 Change variable `mode-line-position' so that the following changes
 are made to the mode line:

 1. Highlight the column number when the current column is greater
    than limit `modelinepos-column-limit'.  Face
    `modelinepos-column-warning' is used for the highlighting.

 2. Make `size-indication-mode' show the size of the region (or the
    shape of the selected rectangle), instead of the buffer size,
    whenever the region is active.

 3. Make `size-indication-mode' show that the current command acts
    on the active region or acts specially because the region is
    now active (Emacs 23+).

 For #2: When the region is active, the mode line displays some
 information that you can customize - see option
 `modelinepos-style'.  Customization choices for this include (a)
 the number of chars, (b) the number of bytes, (c) the number of
 chars and number of lines (or the number of rows and number of
 columns, if a rectangle is selected), and (d) anything else you
 might want.  Choice (c) is the default.

 For (d), you provide a `format' expression as separate components:
 the format string and the sexp arguments to be evaluated and
 plugged into the string.  The number of sexp args depends on the
 format string that you use: one for each `%' construct.

 Choice (d) is provided so that you can choose alternative
 formatting styles.  For example, instead of ` 256 ch, 13 l', you
 could show ` (256 chars, 13 lines)'.  But (d) can really show
 information at all.  It need not have anything to do with the
 region, but it is nevertheless shown when the region is active.

 Option `modelinepos-empty-region-flag' determines whether to show
 the active-region indication when the active region is empty.  By
 default it is t, meaning indicate an empty active region.

 For #3, certain standard Emacs commands act on the active region
 or restrict their scope to it.  Some of these are handled here by
 highlighting the region indication in the mode line specially
 (using face `modelinepos-region-acting-on' instead of face
 `modelinepos-region').  The region-restricted commands defined in
 standard library `replace.el' are handled this way, for example.

 If you also use my library `isearch+.el', which I recommend, then
 (for Emacs 24.3+) Isearch commands too can optionally be
 restricted to the active region, and they too are handled by the
 special mode-line highlighting.  This includes `M-%' and `C-M-%'
 during Isearch, which invoke query-replacement.  Not only is the
 Isearch region indicated in the mode line, but the
 query-replacement command is invoked from Isearch with that region
 active, so it too is limited to that scope.

 Note: Loading this library changes the default definition of
       `mode-line-position'.

 To use this library, put this in your Emacs init file (~/.emacs):

   (require 'modeline-posn)

 To show the column number highlighting, turn on Column Number
 mode.  You can do that in your Emacs init file this way:

   (column-number-mode 1)

 To show the buffer and region size indication in the mode line,
 turn on Size Indication.  You can do that in your Emacs init file
 this way:

   (size-indication-mode 1) ; Turn on Size Indication mode.

 You can customize `modelinepos-column-limit' or bind it to
 different values for different modes.
