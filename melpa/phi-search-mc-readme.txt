phi-search-mc.el provides the following interactive commands:

* phi-search-mc/mark-here
* phi-search-mc/mark-next
* phi-search-mc/mark-previous
* phi-search-mc/mark-all

  These functions serve as great way to add fake cursors at your
  desired points using phi-search.

* phi-search-from-isearch
* phi-search-from-isearch-mc/mark-next
* phi-search-from-isearch-mc/mark-previous
* phi-search-from-isearch-mc/mark-all

Run the following line to rebind `mc/mark-next-like-this',
`mc/mark-previous-like-this' and `mc/mark-all-like-this' in
phi-search buffer to `phi-search-mc/mark-next',
`phi-search-mc/mark-previous' and `phi-search-mc/mark-all',
respectively.

  (phi-search-mc/setup-keys)

Run the following line to bind `phi-search',
`mc/mark-next-like-this', `mc/mark-previous-like-this' and
`mc/mark-all-like-this' in isearch mode to
`phi-search-from-isearch', `phi-search-from-isearch-mc/mark-next',
`phi-search-from-isearch-mc/mark-previous' and
`phi-search-from-isearch-mc/mark-all', respectively.

If you have bound multi-stroke keys to `mc/mark-next-like-this'
etc., this may not be enough.  For example, I bound
[C->]/[C-<]/[C-. !] to mc/mark-* functions, and since they are
complex multi-stroke keys on my terminal emulator where [C->] is
mapped to [C-x @ c >] etc., I had to add the following lines for
the features to work properly.

  (defvar phi-search-from-isearch-mc/ctl-map
    (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
      (define-key map (kbd ">")   'phi-search-from-isearch-mc/mark-next)
      (define-key map (kbd "<")   'phi-search-from-isearch-mc/mark-previous)
      (define-key map (kbd ". !") 'phi-search-from-isearch-mc/mark-all)
      map))

  (defadvice phi-search-from-isearch-mc/setup-keys
    (after for-terminal activate)
    (define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "C-x @ c") phi-search-from-isearch-mc/ctl-map))
