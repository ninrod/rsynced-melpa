This is a simple package that allows Emacs users to compete on [VimGolf][1]
using the One True Editor. Competition can be commenced utilizing `M-x
vimgolf`. When finished with a challenge, `C-c C-v C-c` should finish your
editing, ensure correctness, and submit your score and keystrokes to
[VimGolf][1].

On second thought, let's not go to Camelot. It's a silly place.

Installation:

Use melpa

I make no guarantees that vimgolf.el works with anything but the latest
version of emacs.
