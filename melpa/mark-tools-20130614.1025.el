;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs maintains a set of mark-rings (global and per-buffer) which
;; can be used as a simple "where have I been" log. This library
;; provides a function call list-marks which shows the list of marks
;; and allows a quick navigation to where you were.

;;; Further reading:

;; I've taken some hints from:
;; http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2010/12/22/fixing-mark-commands-transient-mark-mode/

;;; Code:

;; un-comment to debug
;(setq debug-on-error t)
;(setq edebug-all-defs t)

;; I use it for the loop macros
