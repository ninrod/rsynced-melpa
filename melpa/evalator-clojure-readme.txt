 This package extends the evalator package by adding support for
 the Clojure language.

 The commands `evalator-clojure' and `evalator-clojure-explicit'
 can each be used to start an evalator session that uses Clojure as
 the evaluation language.

 `evalator-clojure' will start evalator in normal mode.

 `evalator-clojure-explicit' will start evalator in explicit mode

  NOTE:
  This package uses CIDER to execute Clojure in EMACS so a CIDER
  session must be running and connected to for the functions
  mentioned above to work.
