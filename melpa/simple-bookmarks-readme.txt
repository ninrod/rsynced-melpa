A smart enhancement providing a simple but convenient interface to
your recently and often used bookmarks / functioncalls.

Actually it just holds a persistence list on disk consisting of named function calls with relevant arguments (your bookmarks). The following things are supported:
- Add/remove/execute(call) bookmarks consisting of a name, a function (any function), some relevant arguments/parameters and any other information you want to save with the bookmark
- Add/remove/execute(call) already specialized bookmarks for
-- find-file
-- dired
-- desktop (supports both add existing desktops to bookmark-list and create desktops)
-- browse-url
- Mini-Buffer-Completion for the functions above (should work with ido and ivy)
- Filter the bookmark-list by type/func what ever you want

To use this, add the following lines somewhere in you init file:
(require 'simple-bookmarks)
(simple-bookmarks-init)

handles all bookmarks:
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- l") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-from-all)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- L") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- c") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-add)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- r") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-from-all)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- R") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove)

handles only file-bookmarks:
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- f l") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-file)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- f c") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-add-file)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- f r") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-file)

handles only directory-bookmarks:
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- d l") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-directory)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- d c") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-add-directory)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- d r") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-directory)

handles only desktop-bookmarks:
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- s l") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-desktop)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- s c") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-create-desktop)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- s a") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-add-desktop)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- s r") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-desktop)

handles only url-bookmarks:
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- u l") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-url)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- u c") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-add-url)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-- u r") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-url)

Customization:

If there are other functions you often use, maybe itÂ´s advisable to save these function calls as bookmark. You can make your own bookmark functions. See the functions for file-bookmarks below.

(defun simple-bookmarks-interactive-add-file (&optional name path more)
  (interactive "Sfile-bookmark name: \nffile-bookmark path:\ni")
  (simple-bookmarks-interactive-add name 'find-file (list path) more))

The two functions below are just filtered versions of "simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-file" and "simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-file", so these are not really needed. If you want to provide them, of course you has to provide the corresponding filter.

(defun simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-file ()
  (interactive)
  (simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove 'simple-bookmarks-filters-file-bookmark-p))

(defun simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-file ()
  (interactive)
  (simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute 'simple-bookmarks-filters-file-bookmark-p))
