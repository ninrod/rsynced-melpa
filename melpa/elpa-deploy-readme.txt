This library provides ‘elpa-deploy’: a complement to the function
‘package-upload-file’ from ‘package-x.el’, which automatizes the
deployment of simple and multi-file packages.  This function
automatizes the upload of a library to an ELPA directory so that no
other action is needed.  Particularly useful for rapid ELPA
deployment aiding testing and releases.  The procedures
automatically taken care of consist of updating the version field
of a package source using the current time-stamp, generating its
tar archive if multi-file, and uploading the results to a specified
ELPA directory, while deleting any previous version of the same
package already deployed.
