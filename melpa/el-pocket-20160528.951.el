;; Package-X-Original-Version: 20150202.1528
;; Url: http://github.com/pterygota/el-pocket
;; Keywords: emacs, pocket, bookmarks
;; Package-Requires: ((web "0.5.2") (emacs "24"))
;; Installation/Setup/Usage

;;; Commentary:

;; Put this file in your load-path somewhere and require it.

;; Or use the MELPA repository to install it via package-install.

;; Now do an M-x el-pocket-authorize RET. The first time you do this
;; you will be directed to the oauth/request page, where you can click
;; on authorize. After authorizing, you may see a message that makes
;; it seem like it didn't work (e.g. broken images or redirect
;; failures). This is because we haven't yet set up proper
;; authorization.

;; Now, return to emacs and do M-x el-pocket-authorize RET again. This
;; time you should get an access token, and it will be saved to
;; ~/.el-pocket-auth.json.

;; Once this is done you should be able to use M-x el-pocket-add RET to add URLs.

;; Reading articles still neeed to be added. Maybe it could be
;; integrated using the Diffbot's Article Extraction API

;; Now you can add these lines to your init file for future use:

;;  (require 'el-pocket)
;;  (el-pocket-load-auth)

;;; History:

;; Changes from 0.1 to 0.2:
;; * Remove '*' from names.
;; * Create a customization group and add some doc strings.
;; * Use defvar instead of setq'ing undefined variables.
;; * Address other compilation warnings.

;;; Code:
