;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Given an emacs fileset called e.g. "Public HTML", this call will
;; define a variable representing a helm source from that fileset:
;;
;; (defvar my/helm-source-public-html (helm-make-source-filesets "Public HTML"))
;;
;; Then my/helm-source-public-html can be added to helm-for-files-preferred-list, for example, to provide candidate completion with the helm-for-files
;; function.

;;; Code:

(require 'helm)

;;;###autoload
(defun helm-make-source-filesets (fsname)
  `((name . ,(format "%s Fileset" fsname))
    (init
     . (lambda ()
         (require 'filesets+ nil t)))
    (candidates . (lambda ()
                    (with-helm-current-buffer
                      (filesets-get-filelist (filesets-get-fileset-from-name ,fsname))
                      )))
    (keymap . ,helm-generic-files-map)
    (help-message . helm-generic-file-help-message)
    (mode-line . helm-generic-file-mode-line-string)
    (type . file)))

(provide 'helm-filesets)
