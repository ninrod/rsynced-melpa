;;; Commentary:

;; Add support for Drupal 8+ to ede-php-autoload.
;;
;; Supplies ede-php-autoload with information on the classes located
;; in modules in a Drupal project. All modules found in core/modules,
;; modules, profiles/<profile>/modules and sites/<sites, including
;; default and all>/modules is added.
;;
;; As Drupal uses composer/installers,
;; ede-php-autoload-composer-installers is required for practical use.
