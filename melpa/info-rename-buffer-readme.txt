‘info-rename-buffer-mode’ is a global minor-mode that automatically
renames Info buffers to match their visiting manual.

That’s a useful feature when consulting several Info manuals
simultaneously, because it frees the user from the burden of
renaming Info buffers to descriptive names manually before visiting
another manual, thus avoiding accidentally overriding the currently
visited node in case the user tries to open a new Info buffer.
