This package is a backport of a native functionality of GNU Emacs 24.

This file defines `tabulated-list-mode', a generic major mode for displaying
lists of tabulated data, intended for other major modes to inherit from.  It
provides several utility routines, e.g. for pretty-printing lines of
tabulated data to fit into the appropriate columns.

For usage information, see the documentation of `tabulated-list-mode'.

This package originated from Tom Tromey's Package Menu mode, extended and
generalized to be used by other modes.
