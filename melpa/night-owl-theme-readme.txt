A port of the popular VS Code theme Night Owl. From the VS Code Night Owl README:

A theme for the night owls out there. Works well in the daytime, too, but this theme is
fine-tuned for those of us who like to code late into the night. Color choices have taken
into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness and in low-light
circumstances. Decisions were also based on meaningful contrast for reading comprehension
and for optimal razzle dazzle.
