;;; Commentary:
;; This package provides a minor mode to highlight code coverage in
;; source code files.
;;
;; At present it only knows how to parse coverage data in the format
;; provided by the Simplecov gem.
;;
;; Coverage highlighting will be automatically updated whenever the
;; coverage results change after running specs.  You can individually
;; toggle Coverage on/off in as many buffers as you like.

calls `coverage-set-timer' for internal reasons or in your
