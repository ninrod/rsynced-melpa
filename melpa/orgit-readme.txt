This package defines several Org link types, which can be used to
link to certain Magit buffers.  Use the command `org-store-link'
while such a buffer is current to store a link.  Later you can
insert it into an Org buffer using the command `org-insert-link'.

Format
------

The three link types defined here take these forms:

   orgit:/path/to/repo/            links to a `magit-status' buffer
   orgit-rev:/path/to/repo/::REV   links to a `magit-revision' buffer
   orgit-log:/path/to/repo/::ARGS  links to a `magit-log' buffer

Before v1.3.0 only the first revision was stored in `orgit-log'
links, and all other revisions were discarded.  All other arguments
were also discarded and Magit's usual mechanism for determining the
switches and options was used instead.

For backward compatibility, and because it is the common case and
looks best, ARGS by default has the form REV as before.  However if
linking to a log buffer that shows the log for multiple revisions,
then ("REV"...) is used instead.  If `orgit-log-save-arguments' is
non-nil, then (("REV"...) ("ARG"...) [("FILE"...)]) is always used,
which allows restoring the buffer most faithfully.

Export
------

When an Org file containing such links is exported, then the url of
the remote configured with `orgit-remote' is used to generate a web
url according to `orgit-export-alist'.  That webpage should present
approximately the same information as the Magit buffer would.

Both the remote to be considered the public remote, as well as the
actual web urls can be defined in individual repositories using Git
variables.

To use a remote different from `orgit-remote' but still use
`orgit-export-alist' to generate the web urls, use:

   git config orgit.remote REMOTE-NAME

To explicitly define the web urls, use something like:

   git config orgit.status http://example.com/repo/overview
   git config orgit.rev http://example.com/repo/revision/%r
   git config orgit.log http://example.com/repo/history/%r
