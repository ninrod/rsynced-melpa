Introduction:

It is difficult to communicate emotions using words. There are too many.
They mean different things to different people. Facial expressions, however,
are universal.

"Psychological research has classified six facial expressions which
correspond to distinct universal emotions: disgust, sadness, happiness,
fear, anger, surprise [Black,Yacoob,95]. [Source](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/OldStudentProjects/cs490-95to96/HJKIM/emotions.html)
They are referred to as the [Ekman Expressions](https://www.paulekman.com/universal-facial-expressions/).

All human emotions can be expressed through the combination of
these six emotions.

Use them to precisely communicate yours.
