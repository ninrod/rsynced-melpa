NAME is the name of the test, which is the first argument to

CALLBACKS is a list of callback functions that all must be called
before `ert-async-timeout'.  If all callback functions have not
been called before the timeout, the test fails.

The callback functions should be called without any argument.  If
a callback function is called with a string as argument, the test
will fail with that error string.

BODY is the actual test."
