;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; Useful commands:
;; rbt-status --> shows your current open reviewboard items
;;
;; rbt-review --> when no arguments are supplied, we try to review the current last diff on git HEAD.
;;   If you are currently hovering over a number, we try to use that as a review id
;;    This is useful if you are looking at rbt-status, then run rbt-review when looking at r/123
;;
;; rbt-review-commit --> useful when your cursor is currently over a git commit hash id
;;
;; rbt-review-with-selected --> useful when you don't remember the review id,
;;   and want to be prompted which review to use.
;;
;; rbt-review-close --> useful when your cursor is currently over a review id
;;
;; rbt-review-discard --> useful when your cursor is currently over a review id
