;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides minor-mode for prettifying Guix/Nix store
;; paths, i.e. after enabling `pretty-sha-path-mode',
;; '/gnu/store/72f54nfp6g1hz873w8z3gfcah0h4nl9p-foo-0.1' paths will be
;; replaced with '/gnu/store/…-foo-0.1' paths in the current buffer.
;; There is also `global-pretty-sha-path-mode' for global prettifying.

;; To install, add the following to your emacs init file:
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/pretty-sha-path")
;;   (autoload 'pretty-sha-path-mode "pretty-sha-path" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'global-pretty-sha-path-mode "pretty-sha-path" nil t)

;; If you want to enable/disable composition after "M-x font-lock-mode",
;; use the following setting:
;;
;;   (setq font-lock-extra-managed-props
;;         (cons 'composition font-lock-extra-managed-props))

;; Thanks to Ludovic Courtès for the idea of this package.

;; Thanks to the authors of `prettify-symbols-mode' (part of Emacs 24.4)
;; and "pretty-symbols.el" <http://github.com/drothlis/pretty-symbols>
;; for the code.  It helped to write this package.

By default, after disabling `pretty-sha-path-mode',
compositions (prettifying paths with `pretty-sha-path-char') are
removed only from strings matching `pretty-sha-path-regexp', so
that compositions created by other modes are left untouched.

Set this variable to non-nil, if you want to remove any
composition unconditionally (like `prettify-symbols-mode' does).
Most likely it will do no harm and will make the process of
disabling `pretty-sha-path-mode' a little faster."

With a prefix argument ARG, enable Pretty SHA Path mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.

When Pretty SHA Path mode is enabled, SHA-parts of the Guix/Nix
store paths (see `pretty-sha-path-regexp') are prettified,
i.e. displayed as `pretty-sha-path-char' character.  This mode
can be enabled programmatically using hooks:

  (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'pretty-sha-path-mode)

It is possible to enable the mode in any buffer, however not any
buffer's highlighting may survive after adding new elements to
`font-lock-keywords' (see `pretty-sha-path-special-modes' for
details).

Also you can use `global-pretty-sha-path-mode' to enable Pretty
SHA Path mode for all modes that support font-locking."
