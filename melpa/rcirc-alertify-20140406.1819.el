;;; Commentary:

;; This is a notification system for rcirc that uses jwiegley's
;; `alert' for sending notifications transparently across platforms.
;; It was born out of the frustrations caused by the rcirc-notify.el
;; non-maintenance plus the need of tight integration with rcirc
;; existing mechanisms such as `rcirc-keywords' and
;; `rcirc-ignore-list'.

;; Three types of notifications are provided: keywords, nickname
;; mentions and private messages.  Each have a severity setting called
;; `rcirc-alertify-keywords-severity' `rcirc-alertify-me-severity' and
;; `rcirc-alertify-privmsg-severity' respectively.

;; Event flooding is prevented with the
;; `rcirc-alertify-nickname-timeout' variable which is the time in
;; seconds for which notifications will be ignored in case same events
;; are happening for a given user.

;; If keywords notifications are not desired, they can be easily
;; deactivated by toggling `rcirc-alertify-keywords-p'.

;; Finally, if you are a new user of alert.el, you might need to set
;; your preferred notifier, here is an example config for libnotify:

;; (setq alert-default-style 'libnotify)

;;; Installation:

;; The recommended installation method is using `package-install'.
;; After that's done, just add this to your .emacs:

;; (rcirc-alertify-enable)

;; If you go the hard way, you need a copy of alert.el and add both
;; files to your `load-path' and require rcirc-alertify.

;;; Code:
(require 'alert)
(require 'rcirc)
