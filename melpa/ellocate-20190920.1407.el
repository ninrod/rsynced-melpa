;;; Commentary:

;; This package is a re-implementation of locate written in Emacs Lisp.
;; It recursively searches directories using the find command and then stores the
;; results in the database file specified in `ellocate-scan-dir'.

;; The function `ellocate' scans the directory as specified by `ellocate-scan-dirs'
;; and creates a database file to store the results in.
;; `ellocate-clear' clears all stored databases.
;; This forces `ellocate' to refresh its search entries. Do this if your
;; file-system has changed and you want that reflected in `ellocate'.
