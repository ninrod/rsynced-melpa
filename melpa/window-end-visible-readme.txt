Quickstart

    (require 'window-end-visible)

    ;; open a buffer larger than the window

    ;; may return nil
    M-: (pos-visible-in-window-p (window-end)) RET

    ;; always returns t
    M-: (pos-visible-in-window-p (window-end-visible)) RET

Explanation

Window-end-visible.el has no user-level interface, and is only
useful when programming Emacs Lisp.

This library provides the function `window-end-visible', which
works around a limitation of `window-end', at a speed penalty.

The issue this function solves is that the following is not true
as might be expected:

   (pos-visible-in-window-p (window-end))

`window-end-visible' returns the "true" window end: the last
visible position in the window, verified by testing with
`pos-visible-in-window-p'.

The speed penalty of `window-end-visible' over `window-end' varies
depending on your configuration.  For example, tabbar.el makes
calling `pos-visible-in-window-p' quite expensive.

To use window-end-visible, place the window-end-visible.el library
somewhere Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs
file:

    (require 'window-end-visible)
