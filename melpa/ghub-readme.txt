A minuscule client for the Github API.

Initial configuration:

  $ git config github.user <username>
  $ emacs ~/.authinfo.gpg
  # -*- epa-file-encrypt-to: ("A.U.Thor@example.com") -*-
  machine api.github.com login <login> password <token>

Usage examples:

Get details about a repository:

  (ghub-get "/repos/tarsius/ghub")

List names of all repositories of a user:

  (--keep (cdr (assq 'name it))
          (let ((ghub-unpaginate t))
            (ghub-get "/users/tarsius/repos")))

This library just provides the basic verbs.  Instead of wrapping
every resource, I recommend https://developer.github.com/v3.  Due
to the lack of doc-strings, I also recommend having a quick look
at the source, which is quite trivial.

If you like this, then you might also like `glab.el'; a minuscule
client for the Gitlab API.  See https://gitlab.com/tarsius/glab.

If you don't like this, then you might instead like `gh.el'; a big
client for the Github API.  See https://github.com/sigma/gh.el.
