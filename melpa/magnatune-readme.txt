This is a interface to the music catalog on magnatune.com. It
allows to browse and search the catalog and take actions on an
album or song, like playing it with emms or mpc. It's for those who
like to enjoy magnatune and emacs at the same time!

It needs the sqlite3 command to work. For more info, please see
https://github.com/eikek/magnatune.el.

There is a helm interface to the catalog provided via `(require
'magnatune-helm)'. Obviously helm must be installed (it is not
pulled in automatically).
