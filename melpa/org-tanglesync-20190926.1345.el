;;; Commentary:

;; Pulling external file changes to a tangled org-babel src block
;; is surprisingly not an implemented feature.  This addresses that.
;;
;; Any block that has :tangle <fname> will compare the block with
;; that external <fname>.  When a diff is detected, 1 of 4 actions
;; can occur:
;;   1. External - <fname> contents will override the block contents
;;   2. Internal - block will keep the block contents
;;   3. Prompt - The user will be prompted to pull external changes
;;   4. Diff - A diff of the <fname> and block contents will be produced
;;   5. Custom - A user-defined function will be called instead.
;;
;; These 5 options can be set as the default action by changing the
;; `org-tanglesync-default-diff-action` custom parameter.  Otherwise
;; individual block actions can be set in the org src block header
;; e.g. `:diff external` for pulling external changes without
;; prompt into a specific block.
;;
;; This package also provides a hook when the org src block is
;; being edited (e.g. via `C-c '`) which asks the user if they
;; want to pull external changes if a difference is detected.
;; The user can bypass this and always pull by setting the
;; `org-tanglesync-skip-user-check` custom parameter.
