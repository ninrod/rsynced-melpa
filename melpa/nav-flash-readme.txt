Quickstart

    (require 'nav-flash)

    (nav-flash-show)

Explanation

Nav-flash temporarily highlights the line containing the point,
which is sometimes useful for orientation after a navigation
command.

To use nav-flash, place the nav-flash.el library somewhere Emacs
can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'nav-flash)

There is no user-level interface for this library; it is only used
by other Lisp libraries.  However, you might find it useful to call
`nav-flash-show' in your ~/.emacs file.  For example, the following
hook causes a flash to appear after navigating via imenu:

    (add-hook 'imenu-after-jump-hook 'nav-flash-show nil t)

    M-x customize-group RET pulse RET

Notes

    This library reuses a timer and overlay defined in compile.el,
    but should not affect the normal use of compile.el / `next-error'.

    Pulse.el provides similar functionality and is included with
    Emacs.  This library can use pulse.el, but does not do so by
    default, because pulse.el uses `sit-for', breaking this type
    of construction:

        (nav-flash-show)
        (with-temp-message "message here"
           (sit-for 2))

    When using an overlay and timer for cleanup (as nav-flash does
    by default) the flash and message appear simultaneously.

    Nav-flash.el is also simpler than pulse.el.
