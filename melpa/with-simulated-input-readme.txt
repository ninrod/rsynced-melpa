This package provides a single macro, `with-simulated-input', which
evaluates one or more forms while simulating a sequence of input
events for those forms to read. The result is the same as if you
had evaluated the forms and then manually typed in the same input.
This macro is useful for non-interactive testing of normally
interactive commands and functions, such as `completing-read'.
