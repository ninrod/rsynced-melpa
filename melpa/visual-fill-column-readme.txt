`visual-fill-column-mode' is a small Emacs minor mode that mimics the effect of `fill-column'
in `visual-line-mode'.  Instead of wrapping lines at the window edge, which
is the standard behaviour of `visual-line-mode', it wraps lines at
`fill-column'.  If `fill-column' is too large for the window, the text is
wrapped at the window edge.
