Just fold the active region, please.

## How it works

The command `fold-this` visually replaces the current region with `[[â€¦]]`.
If you move point into the ellipsis and press enter or `C-g` it is unfolded.

You can unfold everything with `fold-this-unfold-all`.

You can fold all instances of the text in the region with `fold-this-all`.
