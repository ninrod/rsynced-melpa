;;; Commentary:

;; Execute Elvish code inside org-mode src blocks.

;;; Requirements:

;; - The Elvish shell: https://elvish.io/
;; - The elvish-mode Emacs major mode: https://github.com/ALSchwalm/elvish-mode

;;; Code:
(require 'ob)
(require 'ob-ref)
(require 'ob-comint)
(require 'ob-eval)
;; possibly require modes required for your language

;; set the language mode to be used for Elvish blocks
(add-to-list 'org-src-lang-modes '("elvish" . elvish))

;; optionally define a file extension for this language
(add-to-list 'org-babel-tangle-lang-exts '("elvish" . "elv"))

;; optionally declare default header arguments for this language
