An auto-magical, which-key-based hydra banisher.

With almost no set-up code, Hercules lets you call any group of
related command sequentially with no prefix keys, while showing a
handy popup to remember the bindings for those commands.  It can
create both of these (the grouped commands, and the popup) from any
keymap.
