;;; Commentary:

;; Enable the global minor mode `mode-line-bell-mode' to set
;; `ring-bell-function' to a function that will briefly flash the mode
;; line when the bell is rung.

;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(defun mode-line-bell-flash ()
  "Flash the mode line momentarily."
  (invert-face 'mode-line)
  (run-with-timer 0.05 nil 'invert-face 'mode-line))


;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode mode-line-bell-mode
  "Flash the mode line instead of ringing the bell."
  :lighter nil
  :global t
  (setq-default ring-bell-function (when mode-line-bell-mode
                                     'mode-line-bell-flash)))


(provide 'mode-line-bell)
;;; mode-line-bell.el ends here
