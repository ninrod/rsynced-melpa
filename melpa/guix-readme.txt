Emacs-Guix (aka "guix.el") provides featureful visual interface for
the GNU Guix package manager.  It allows you:

- to search for packages and to look at their code (package recipes);

- to manage your Guix profile(s) by installing/removing packages;

- to look at, compare and remove profile generations;

- to look at system services and generations (if you use GuixSD);

- to do many other things.

Run "M-x guix-help" to look at the summary of available commands.
