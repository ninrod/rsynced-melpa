Simple minor mode that let's you quickly type common unicode
emoticons. Emoticons are stored as abbrev definitions. To enable:
M-x unicode-emoticons-mode <RET>
M-x abbrev-mode <RET>

After that you can type "shrug0" which will expand to:
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

In order to see the definitions: M-x list-abbrevs <RET>
