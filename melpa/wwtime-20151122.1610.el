;;; Commentary:
;;
;; I frequently arrange teleconferences with participants from several
;; time zones. In an effort to reduce confusion about the time of the
;; meeting, I try to publish the time in several relevant time zones.

;; But correctly calculating EST, PST, GMT, CET, and JST, for example,
;; requires too much thought. That's what computers are for. And since
;; I'm usually sending email reminders of the meeting time, that's
;; what Emacs is for.  And that's what this code is for.

;;; Usage:
;;
;; (wwtime)
;;
;; wwtime will prompt for the time of day in the minibuffer. The time
;; entered will be inserted into the current buffer in each of the
;; time zones listed in wwtime-display. Note that the time can be
;; entered in any time zone, but will always be displayed in the time
;; zones listed in wwtime-display (and the time zone entered, even
;; if it is not a member of wwtime-display).
;;
;; The time displayed will be followed by a + or - to indicate tomorrow
;; or yesterday (with respect to the time zone entered).

;; (wwtime-convert)
;;
;; wwtime-convert prompts for a time of day and two time zones. It
;; converts the time from the first time zone to the second and displays
;; the result in the minibuffer.

;;; Example:
;;
;; Given the default settings, (wwtime) for "15:00 AKST" will insert:
;; "15:00AKST (07:00p EST, 04:00p PST, 00:00GMT+, 01:00CET+, 09:00JST+) "

;;; Customization:

;; There are five customization variables. As of version 1.1, you can
;; set these with the Emacs customization feature. Wwtime is in the
;; "Convenience" group under M-x customize.

;; wwtime-time-zones is the list of recognized time zones
;; wwtime-display is the list of time zones to display
;; wwtime-ampm is a list of time zones that use 12-hour am/pm format
;; wwtime-default-function is the function that calculates the default time
;; wwtime-time-zone-aliases maps long time zone names to one-word names

;;; Changes

;; v1.5
;;   Added (provide 'wwwtime)

;; v1.4
;;   No changes; just needed to sync with a bug on the wwtime web page.

;; v1.3
;;   Initialize wwtime-convert-history (really, this time!)
;;   Add time zone aliases (to convert "Eastern Standard Time" to "EST"
;;     automatically)
;;   Fold time zone names to uppercase (so that lowercase and mixed case
;;     names can be entered by the user)

;; v1.2
;;   Support swatch time (timezone '@')
;;   Initialize wwtime-convert-history
;;
;; v1.1
;;   Always display timezone entered
;;   Use emacs customize
;;   Added wwtime-convert
;;
;; v1.0
;;   First release
