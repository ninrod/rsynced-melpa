This Emacs package lets you manage local Git identities, i.e.
user.name and user.email options in .git/config, inside
Emacs.  It can be useful if you satisfy all of the following
conditions:

- You have multiple Git identities on the same machine(s).

- You use Emacs.

- You almost always use magit for Git operations on your
  machine(s).
