;;; Commentary:

;; This package defines additional commands to kill and delete text.
;; Most notably it defines "smarter" variants of some built-in
;; commands which delete text.  Where the built-in command always
;; deletes text the variant defined here instead kills the text if
;; (and only if) the previous command was a kill command.

;; Note that this package is not namespace-safe.
