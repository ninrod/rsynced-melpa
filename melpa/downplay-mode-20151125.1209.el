;;; Commentary:

;; Downplay is a minor Emacs mode that provides facilities to apply a
;; face (via overlays) to all but the current region or line. 
;;
;; To enable Downplay minor mode, type M-x downplay-mode.
;; This applies only to the current buffer.
;;
;; When 'downplay is called, it will change the downplayed state of
;; the buffer depending on the current state:
;;
;; - when the downplay is inactive:
;;   - if the region is active and transient-mark-mode is active,
;;     downplay-face is applied to all of the buffer except the region
;;   - else downplay-face is applied to all of the buffer except the
;;     current line
;; - when the downplay is active:
;;   - if the region is active and transient-mark-mode is active and
;;     the region has changed since the downplay was activated,
;;     downplay-face is reapplied to all of the buffer except the
;;     region
;;   - else if the current line has changed, downplay-face is
;;     reapplied to all of the buffer except the current line
;;   - else the downplay is deactivated (downplay-face is unapplied
;;     from the entire buffer) 
;;
;; By default, 'downplay is bound to C-c z when downplay-mode is
;; active. The default downplay-face sets the height of the text to
;; 0.75.
