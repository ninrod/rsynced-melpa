This package provides an interface to the Fluxus live coding environment.

According to the official Fluxus site at http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/ ,
Fluxus is a 3D game engine for livecoding worlds into existence.  It is
a rapid prototyping, playing and learning environment for 3D graphics,
sound and games.  It extends the Racket language with graphical commands
and can be used within its own livecoding environment or from within the
DrRacket IDE.

This package allows Fluxus to be used from within Emacs.
