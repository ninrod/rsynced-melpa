;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Magit-tbdiff provides a Magit interface to git-tbdiff [1,2], a Git
;; extension for comparing two versions of a topic branch.
;;
;; There are three commands for calling git-tbdiff:
;;
;;   * `magit-tbdiff-ranges' is the most generic of the three
;;     commands.  It reads two ranges that represent the two series to
;;     be compared.
;;
;;   * `magit-tbdiff-revs' reads two revisions.  From these (say, "A"
;;     and "B"), it constructs the two series as B..A and A..B.
;;
;;   * `magit-tbdiff-revs-with-base' is like the previous command, but
;;     it also reads a base revision, constructing the range as
;;     <base>..A and <base>..B.
;;
;; These commands are available in the popup `magit-tbdiff-popup',
;; which in turn is available in the Magit diff popup, bound by
;; default to "i" (for "interdiff").  So, with the default
;; keybindings, you can invoke the tbdiff popup with "di".
;;
;; When Magit-tbdiff is installed from MELPA, no additional setup is
;; needed (aside installing git-tbdiff so that Git can find it [1]).
;; The tbdiff popup will be added under the Magit diff popup, and
;; Magit-tbdiff will be loaded the first time that the tbdiff popup is
;; invoked.
