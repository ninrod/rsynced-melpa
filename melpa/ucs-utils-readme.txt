Explanation

This library provides utilities for manipulating Unicode
characters, with integrated ability to return fallback characters
when Unicode display is not possible.

Some ambiguities in Emacs' built-in Unicode data are resolved, and
character support is updated to Unicode 8.0.

There are three interactive commands:

    `ucs-utils-ucs-insert'       ; `ucs-insert' workalike using ido
    `ucs-utils-eval'             ; the inverse of `ucs-insert'
    `ucs-utils-install-aliases'  ; install shorter aliases

The other functions are only useful from other Lisp code:

    `ucs-utils-char'
    `ucs-utils-first-existing-char'
    `ucs-utils-vector'
    `ucs-utils-string'
    `ucs-utils-intact-string'
    `ucs-utils-pretty-name'
    `ucs-utils-read-char-by-name'
    `ucs-utils-subst-char-in-region'

To use ucs-utils, place the ucs-utils.el library somewhere Emacs
can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'ucs-utils)

and optionally

    (ucs-install-aliases)

Notes

Compatibility and Requirements

    GNU Emacs version 25.1-devel     : not tested
    GNU Emacs version 24.5           : not tested
    GNU Emacs version 24.4           : yes
    GNU Emacs version 24.3           : yes
    GNU Emacs version 23.3           : yes (*)
    GNU Emacs version 22.3 and lower : no

    (*) For full Emacs 23.x support, the library ucs-utils-6.0-delta.el
        should also be installed.

    Uses if present: persistent-soft.el (Recommended)

Bugs

TODO

    Accept synonyms on inputs? at least Tab would be nice.
    There is an official list of aliases at

        http://www.unicode.org/Public/8.0.0/ucd/NameAliases.txt

    generated names for CJK blocks added in Unicode 6.2
        CJK Unified Ideographs
        CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A
        CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C

    support alternate naming schemes for CJK ideographs

    support helm or other choosers which are able to cope
    with the entire set of character names, including
    CJK ideographs

    spin out older portions of ucs-utils-names-corrections
    which are not needed in recent Emacs releases (as with
    ucs-utils-6.0-delta.el)

    Namespace cache keys as with font-utils and unicode-utils.

    Separate test run without persistent-soft.el
