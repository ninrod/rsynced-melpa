Call `tox-current-test' or `tox-current-cast' to launch the current
test or class with tox.  with an argument it will read the tox.ini
and ask you for a value for a tox environment variable.

Originally the ideas was coming from nosetests.el (written by me)
which was modified by Julien Danjou <julien@danjou.info) and
adapted to tox.
