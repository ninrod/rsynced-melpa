Install:
(require 'evil-visualstar)

Usage:

(global-evil-visualstar-mode t)

Make a visual selection with `v` or `V`, and then hit `*` to search
the selection forward, or # to search that selection backward.

If the evil-visualstar/persistent option is not nil, visual-state
will remain in effect, allowing for repeated * or #.
