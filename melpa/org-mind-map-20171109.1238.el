;;; Commentary:

;; This package takes an org-mode tree and converts it into a
;; file that can be read into graphviz in order to visually show the
;; tree as a directed graph.  Mail to <theodore.wiles@gmail.com> to discuss
;; features and additions.  All suggestions are more than welcome.

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below is a complete list of commands:
;;
;;  `org-mind-map-write'
;;    Create a digraph based on all org trees in the current buffer.
;;    Keybinding: M-x org-mind-map-write
;;  `org-mind-map-write-current-branch'
;;    Create a directed graph output based on just the current org tree branch.
;;    Keybinding: M-x org-mind-map-write-current-branch
;;  `org-mind-map-write-current-tree'
;;    Create a directed graph output based on the whole current org tree.
;;    Keybinding: M-x org-mind-map-write-current-tree
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below is a list of customizable options:
;;
;;  `org-mind-map-wrap-line-length'
;;    Line length within graphviz nodes.
;;    default = 30
;;  `org-mind-map-wrap-legend-line-length'
;;    Line length of the graphviz legend.
;;    default = 45
;;  `org-mind-map-unflatten-command'
;;    Shell executable command for running the UNFLATTEN command.
;;    default = "unflatten -l3"
;;  `org-mind-map-dot-command'
;;    Shell executable command for running the DOT command.
;;    default = "dot"
;;  `org-mind-map-dot-output'
;;    Format of the DOT output.  Defaults to PDF.
;;    default = "pdf"
;;  `org-mind-map-rankdir'
;;    Sets the order of the resulting graph.
;;    default = "LR"
;;  `org-mind-map-engine'
;;    Sets the layout engine used in your graphs.
;;    default = "dot"
;;  `org-mind-map-node-formats'
;;    Assoc list of (NAME . FN) pairs where NAME is a value for the :OMM-NODE-FMT property 
;;    default = nil
;;  `org-mind-map-edge-formats'
;;    Assoc list of (NAME . FN) pairs where NAME is a value for the :OMM-EDGE-FMT property
;;    default = nil
;;  `org-mind-map-edge-format-default'
;;    Default format string for graph edges, e.g. "[style=dotted]".
;;    default = ""

;; The headings of the org-mode file are treated as node text in the resulting tree.
;; Org-mode heading tags are included in the resulting tree as additional cells
;; within the node.

;; The tags are color-coded to be consistent across the tree.

;; Tree interleaving is also possible by naming multiple org-mode headings
;; with the same heading.

;; NOTE: this requires the GRAPHVIZ software.  This is installable on
;; windows using cygwin.

;; To install, add this code to your .emacs:
;; (load "org-mind-map.el")

;; If on linux, customize the values of `org-mind-map-unflatten-command'
;; and `org-mind-map-dot-command' to have the values corresponding to
;; the executables in your system.

;; Then, run "M-x org-mind-map-write" to create a graph of all trees in the current buffer,

;; You can customize the style of the graph by adding :OMM-NODE-FMT and :OMM-EDGE-FMT properties
;; to the headlines in the tree.

;; The latest version is available at:

;; https://github.com/theodorewiles/org-mind-map
