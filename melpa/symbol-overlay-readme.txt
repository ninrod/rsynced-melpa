Highlighting symbols with overlays while providing a keymap for various
operations about highlighted symbols.  It was originally inspired by the
package `highlight-symbol'.  The fundamental difference is that in
`symbol-overlay' every symbol is highlighted by the Emacs built-in function
`overlay-put' rather than the `font-lock' mechanism used in
`highlight-symbol'.

Advantages

In `symbol-overlay', `overlay-put' is much faster than the traditional
highlighting method `font-lock' especially in a large buffer, or even a
less-than-100-lines small buffer of major-mode with complicated keywords
syntax,like haskell-mode.  Besides, all the overlays of each symbol are
sequentially stored in an alist `symbol-overlay-keywords-alist', from which
the number of occurrences can be immediately obtained.  While in
`highlight-symbol', counting the number occurrences would call the function
`how-many' twice, causing extra costs.

When highlighting symbols with overlays, **an auto-activated overlay-inside
keymap** will enable you to call various useful commands with **a single
keystroke**.

Toggle overlays of all occurrences of symbol at point: `symbol-overlay-put'
Remove all highlighted symbols in the buffer: `symbol-overlay-remove-all'
Jump between locations of symbol at point: `symbol-overlay-jump-next' &
`symbol-overlay-jump-prev'
Jump to the definition of symbol at point: `symbol-overlay-jump-to-definition'
Switch to the closest symbol highlighted nearby:
`symbol-overlay-switch-forward' & `symbol-overlay-switch-backward'
Query replace symbol at point: `symbol-overlay-query-replace'
Rename symbol at point on all its occurrences: `symbol-overlay-rename'

Usage

To use `symbol-overlay' in your Emacs, you need only to bind three keys:
(require 'symbol-overlay)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-i") 'symbol-overlay-put)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-u") 'symbol-overlay-switch-backward)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-o") 'symbol-overlay-switch-forward)

Default key-bindings are defined in `symbol-overlay-map'.
You can re-bind the commands to any keys you prefer by simply writing
(define-key symbol-overlay-map (kbd "your-prefer-key") 'any-command)
