Playground is a playground for Emacs. Its basic idea is to create
an isolated directory called a sandbox and make it $HOME of Emacs.
Playground allows you to easily experiment with various Emacs configuration
repositories available on GitHub, while keeping your current configuration
untouched (almost, except for a stuff for Playground). It can also simplify
your workflow in Emacs by hiding irrelevant files and directories
existing in your home directory.
