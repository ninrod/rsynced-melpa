;;; Commentary:
;; Helm extension for inserting the reference to an org source block
;; function from the library of babel.
;;
;; The available functions consist of all named source
;; blocks in the current org file and of the functions defined in the
;; user's library of babel.

;;; Code:
(require 'helm)
(require 'org)
(require 'cl-lib)

;; Note: I cannot use lexical binding here since seemingly the lambdas which
;; I define below are handed over to helm and helm does not use lexical binding,
;; so I would then end with a "

  "Helm function to insert a reference to an org source block function.

The available functions consist of all functions defined in the
library of babel (q.v. `org-babel-library-of-babel',
`org-babel-lob-ingest') as well as all the named source blocks
found in the current file.  The available actions include:

Insert a #+CALL: function.  The CALL function arguments are pre-filled
with the function's default arguments.

Insert a :post header argument for a source block

Insert an `org-sbe' form usually used in table functions.  Again,
the function default arguments are added as arguments to the
`org-sbe' call."
