A major mode for editing LEMON Parser Generator grammar files.

Lemon <http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/> is a simple but very
powerful parser generator for C/C++. This major mode helps you edit
Lemon's grammar files in Emacs.

lemon-mode.el provides two major modes (1) `lemon-c-mode' and (2)
`lemon-c++-mode', which allow you to explicitly specify the base
editing mode. The base editing mode affects syntax highlighting and
indentation mechanism.
