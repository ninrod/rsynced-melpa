A search framework which let you search string or regular expression
in the background and queue the search tasks. It uses `find`, `grep`,
`ack` or `ag` command as its searching backends. In addition, the
search result can be a jotting. So it keeps the search result for
you and provides editing function.

TODO
----
* Support AG.
* Improve interaction of `searchq-search' and `searchq-search-command'.
* Cancel individual search task.
* Open with searchq-result will cause hl-highlight-mode work incorrectly.
