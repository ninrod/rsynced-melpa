;;; Commentary:

;; AnyBar is an application that puts an indicator in the menubar in
;; OS X. This package lets you interact with that indicator from
;; Emacs. See: https://github.com/tonsky/AnyBar

;; Basic usage:
;;
;;   (require 'anybar)
;;
;; Start AnyBar:
;;
;;   (anybar-start)
;;
;; Set indicator to a color:
;;
;;   (anybar-set "red")
;;
;; Quit AnyBar:
;;
;;   (anybar-quit)
;;
;; Those functions also take an optional argument to specify a port
;; number, if you want to run multiple instances or use a different
;; port than AnyBar's default, 1738.
;;
;; `anybar-set' will complain if you try to set the indicator to an
;; invalid style, which is anything outside of the default styles (see
;; `anybar-styles') or any custom images set in "~/.AnyBar". To
;; refresh the list of images anybar.el knows about, call
;; `anybar-images-reset'.
;;
;; These functions may be called interactively.
;;
;; If you have installed AnyBar to a location other than
;; /Applications/AnyBar.app, you'll need to customize
;; `anybar-executable-location' so that `anybar-start' may succeed.
;;
;; Enjoy!
