Run, evaluate and compile functionality for a variety of different languages
and modes.  The specific "compilation" method is different across each
add-on library.  For example, for ESS and Clojure you can evaluate a
specific file and/or evaluate a specfic expression via a REPL.  For running
a script or starting a `make' an async process is started.
