Funny Copy (Fcopy) is a minor mode to copy text; first, set the
paste point, and next look for the text to copy.  The past point is
the point where fcopy-mode start.  One stroke commands are prepared
to search and copy the text.  Copy commands automatically take the
cursor back to the past point, insert the text, and exit
fcopy-mode.

`q' and `C-g' is for exit fcopy-mode.  `?' for more help.

If you want to move (cut) text, not to copy, type `C-d' to toggle
on delete flag.  If the buffer is originally read only, deleting
and copying will fail.

If some scratches are in your copy text, you can modify it before
paste.  Before the copy command, type `m' to toggle on modify flag.
It prepares modify buffer, that you can modify the text with
replacement or overwrite.  See `fmodify-default-mode' or `C-h m' in
the modify buffer.  To insert modified text, type `C-cC-c'.
`C-cC-q' for quit modifying, and paste nothing.

The latest fcopy.el is available at:

The other simple copy command is distributed with Emacs.  See
misc.el in your lisp directory.  It copies characters from previous
non-blank line, starting just above point.  But remember, fcopy has
no influences from misc.el.
