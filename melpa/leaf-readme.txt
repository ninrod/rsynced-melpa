Provides macros that allow you to declaratively configure settings typical
of an Elisp package with various keywords.

By separating the settings of a package and combining many 'leaves' of a
package's settings, you could make a 'Yggdrasill' on top of your Emacs.

A leaf can consist of multiple packages, in which case you can disable all
dependent child packages by disabling one parent's package.

It also has a key management system and package management uses the
package.el.  With minimal external dependencies and careful implementation,
this package is guaranteed to be fully functional from Emacs-23, now, and
in future Emacs.
