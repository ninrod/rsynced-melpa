Commands for tty-mode emacs when running under xterm, to manipulate the
parent xterm state.  Some of these commands may only work with post-1996
XFree86 xterm versions.

Color defaults and algorithms derived from the xterm-189 (2004-5-16)
distribution from http://dickey.his.com/xterm/
In particular see XTerm-col.ad and 256colres.pl
These values may differ from those of earlier releases of xterm.
