Do you often yank source code into your org files, manually
surrounding it in #+BEGIN_SRC blocks? This package will give you a
new way of pasting that automatically surrounds the snippet in
blocks, marked with the major mode of where the code came from,
and adds a link to the source file after the block.

To use, require and bind whatever keys you prefer to the
interactive functions:

(require 'org-rich-yank)
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-M-y") #'org-rich-yank)


If you prefer `use-package', the above settings would be:

(use-package org-rich-yank
  :ensure t
  :config
  (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-M-y") #'org-rich-yank))
