**** Obsolete since Emacs 24.4: Users should customize or otherwise
**** modify the new `package-pinned-packages` variable instead.

This package adds functionality to `package.el` to allow creating
a whitelist or blacklist of packages for a specific repository.
This allows for disabling all packages from a specific repository
and only enabling certain packages, or simply blacklist a certain
subset of packages.
