;;; Commentary:

;; smart-mark-mode is a global minor mode.
;; When it is active and you press C-g after a mark function,
;; the cursor restores to its initial location.

;;; Code:

(defvar smart-mark-point-before-mark nil
  "Cursor position before mark.")

(defconst smart-mark-mark-functions
  '(mark-page mark-paragraph mark-whole-buffer mark-sexp mark-defun mark-word)
  "Functions with marking behavior.")

(defun smart-mark-set-restore-before-mark (&rest args)
  (setq smart-mark-point-before-mark (point)))

(defun smart-mark-restore-cursor ()
  "Restore cursor position saved just before mark."
  (when smart-mark-point-before-mark
    (goto-char smart-mark-point-before-mark)
    (setq smart-mark-point-before-mark nil)))

(defun smart-mark-restore-cursor-when-cg ()
  (when (memq last-command smart-mark-mark-functions)
    (smart-mark-restore-cursor)))

(defun smart-mark-advice-all ()
  "Advice all `smart-mark-mark-functions' so that point is initially saved."
  (mapc (lambda (f)
          (advice-add f :before #'smart-mark-set-restore-before-mark))
   smart-mark-mark-functions)
  (advice-add #'keyboard-quit :before #'smart-mark-restore-cursor-when-cg))

(defun smart-mark-remove-advices ()
  "Remove all advices for `smart-mark-mark-functions'."
