;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a simple command to toggle a number under the cursor
;; between having grouped digits and not.  For example, if the buffer is as
;; shown with the cursor at the '*':
;;
;; Travel expense is 4654254654*
;;
;; invoking commify-toggle will change the buffer to:
;;
;; Travel expense is 4,654,254,654*
;;
;; Calling commify-toggle again removes the commas.  The cursor can also be
;; anywhere in the number or immediately before or after the number.
;; commify-toggle works on floating or scientific numbers as well, but it only
;; ever affects the digits before the decimal point.  Afterwards, the cursor
;; will be placed immediately after the affected number.
;;
;; You can configure these variables:
;;   - commify-group-char (default ",") to the char used for grouping
;;   - commify-group-size (default 3) to number of digits per group
;;   - commify-decimal-char (default ".") to the char used as a decimal point.
;;
;; Bind the main function to a convenient key in you init.el file:
;;
;;    (key-chord-define-global ",," 'commify-toggle)
