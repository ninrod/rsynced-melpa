This is a high-contrast theme designed to accentuate three visual 'layers':

1) Comments are in red.  The intent is for comments to stand out!  Use them
sparingly, to draw the reader's attention to problematic or tricky code.

2) Strings are furnished with a light yellow background, so it's easier to
track where they start and end.

3) Function definitions are in bold.
