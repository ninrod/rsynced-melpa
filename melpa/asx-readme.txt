This package allows you to search any StackExchange site specified in
`asx-sites' and insert the top post in an Org-mode buffer. For better searching,
this uses Google and DuckDuckGo as it is superior to StackExchange's searching
capabilities. More search engines can be defined using `asx-search-engine-alist'.

# Usage
Run ~M-x asx~ and enter query when prompted.
