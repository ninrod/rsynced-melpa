Toggle test provides test toggle functionality very similar to Jetbrains
IDEs like IntelliJ/Rubymine/Pycharm. It presents
the user with choices in case there are multiple macthes (Ex: You have
integration and unit test for the same source file). It creates the file
(test or source), along with the entire directory hierarchy if the file does
not exist.
It is language agnostic so you can use it on your rails, django, scala, node.js
or any other projects.
