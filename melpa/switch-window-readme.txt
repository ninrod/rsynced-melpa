2. M-x package-install RET switch-window RET

Note: User can install switch-window with [[http://github.com/dimitri/el-get][El-Get]] too.

** Configure and Usage

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'switch-window)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x o") 'switch-window)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x 1") 'switch-window-then-maximize)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x 2") 'switch-window-then-split-below)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x 3") 'switch-window-then-split-right)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x 0") 'switch-window-then-delete)
#+END_EXAMPLE

When switch-window is enabled, user can use the below five keys:

| key | command description   |
|-----+-----------------------|
| "i" | Move the border up    |
| "k" | Move the border down  |
| "j" | Move the border left  |
| "k" | Move the border right |
| "b" | Balance windows       |

If you want to customize this feature, please see variable:
`switch-window-extra-map'.

** Tips

*** I want to select a window with "a-z" instead of "1-9".
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(setq switch-window-shortcut-style 'qwerty)
(setq switch-window-qwerty-shortcuts
      '("a" "s" "d" "f" "j" "k" "l" ";" "w" "e" "i" "o"))
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** I want to let window to show bigger label.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(setq switch-window-increase 6) ;Increase or decrease this number.
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** I want to *hide* window label when window's number < 3
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(setq switch-window-threshold 2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** I want to select minibuffer with label "z".
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(setq switch-window-minibuffer-shortcut ?z)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Switch-window seem to conflict with Exwm, how to do?
By default, switch-window get user's input with the help
of function `read-event', this approach does not work well
with [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][Exwm]] (Emacs X window manager),
user should set the below variable and use minibuffer
to get input instead:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(setq switch-window-input-style 'minibuffer)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note: if you use minibuffer to get input, the feature about
`switch-window-minibuffer-shortcut' will not work well.

*** I use text terminal, but I want *bigger* label.
The only choice is using asciiart, which *draw* a bigger label
with *small* ascii char.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(setq switch-window-shortcut-appearance 'asciiart)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** I want to use image or icon as label.
1. Prepare your label images, rename them to:
   1.png ... 9.png, a.png ... z.png.

   You can use other image types supported by
   emacs, please see: `image-types'.
2. Put all above images to directory:
   `switch-window-image-directory'.
3. Set variable: `switch-window-shortcut-appearance'
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   (setq switch-window-shortcut-appearance 'image)
   #+END_EXAMPLE

[[./snapshots/switch-window-2.png]]

*** `switch-window-shortcut-appearance' can't satisfy my need. how to do?
All you should do is hacking you own label buffer function,
for example: my-switch-window-label-buffer-function, and set
the below variable:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(setq switch-window-label-buffer-function
      'my-switch-window-label-buffer-function)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Have any other similar package exist?
