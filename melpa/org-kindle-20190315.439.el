;;; Commentary:
;;;
;; This is package makes an Emacs bridge between Kindle (other ereaders
;; supports could work in theoretically) and Org Mode.
;; In theatrically, this package should work for non-kindle ereaders too. User can
;; set device path in variables. But becaused not tested, so I can't guarantee that
;; package will work correctly. But PR welcome to improve it. I appreciate it.
;;
;; This packages use a command `ebook-convert' which comes from
;; [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]]. So if you want to use auto convert
;; functionality, you need to install it manuall.
;;
;; - It support send Org Mode file: link file to Kindle or other ereaders like Nook.

;;; Todos:
;;
;; - Support sync Kindle notes with Org Mode notes file.

;; Usage:
;;
;; [M-x org-kindle]
