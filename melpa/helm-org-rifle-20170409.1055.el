;;; helm-org-rifle.el --- Rifle through your Org files

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; Url: http://github.com/alphapapa/helm-org-rifle
;; Package-Version: 20170409.1055
;; Version: 1.4.0-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.4") (dash "2.12") (f "0.18.1") (helm "1.9.4") (s "1.10.0"))
;; Keywords: hypermedia, outlines

;;; Commentary:

;; This is my rifle.  There are many like it, but this one is mine.
;; My rifle is my best friend. It is my life.  I must master it as I
;; must master my life.

;; What does my rifle do?  It searches rapidly through my Org files,
;; quickly bringing me the information I need to defeat the enemy.

;; This package is inspired by org-search-goto/org-search-goto-ml.  It
;; searches both headings and contents of entries in Org buffers, and
;; it displays entries that match all search terms, whether the terms
;; appear in the heading, the contents, or both.  Matching portions of
;; entries' contents are displayed with surrounding context to make it
;; easy to acquire your target.

;; Entries are fontified by default to match the appearance of an Org
;; buffer, and optionally the entire path can be displayed for each
;; entry, rather than just its own heading.

;;; Installation:

;;;; MELPA

;; If you installed from MELPA, your rifle is ready.  Just run one of
;; the commands below.

;;;; Manual

;; Install the Helm, dash.el, f.el, and s.el packages.  Then require
;; this package in your init file:

;; (require 'helm-org-rifle)

;;; Usage:

;; Run one of the rifle commands, type some words, and results will be
;; displayed, grouped by buffer.  Hit "RET" to show the selected
;; entry, or <C-return> to show it in an indirect buffer.

;; Helm commands: show results in a Helm buffer
;; + `helm-org-rifle': Show results from all open Org buffers
;; + `helm-org-rifle-agenda-files': Show results from Org agenda files
;; + `helm-org-rifle-current-buffer': Show results from current buffer
;; + `helm-org-rifle-directories': Show results from selected directories; with prefix, recursively
;; + `helm-org-rifle-files': Show results from selected files
;; + `helm-org-rifle-org-directory': Show results from Org files in `org-directory'

;; Occur commands: show results in an occur-like, persistent buffer
;; + `helm-org-rifle-occur': Show results from all open Org buffers
;; + `helm-org-rifle-occur-agenda-files': Show results from Org agenda files
;; + `helm-org-rifle-occur-current-buffer': Show results from current buffer
;; + `helm-org-rifle-occur-directories': Show results from selected directories; with prefix, recursively
;; + `helm-org-rifle-occur-files': Show results from selected files
;; + `helm-org-rifle-occur-org-directory': Show results from Org files in `org-directory'

;;;; Tips

;; + Select multiple entries in the Helm buffer to display selected
;;   entries in a read-only, `occur`-style buffer.
;; + Save all results in a Helm buffer to a `helm-org-rifle-occur`
;;   buffer by pressing `C-s` (like `helm-grep-save-results`).
;; + Show results from certain buffers by typing the name of the
;;   buffer (usually the filename).
;; + Show headings with certain to-do keywords by typing the keyword,
;;   e.g. `TODO` or `DONE`.
;; + Show headings with certain priorities by typing, e.g. `#A` or
;;   `[#A]`.
;; + Show headings with certain tags by searching for,
;;   e.g. `:tag1:tag2:`.
;; + Negate matches with a `!`, e.g. `pepperoni !anchovies`.
;; + Sort results by timestamp or buffer-order (the default) by
;;   calling commands with a universal prefix (`C-u`).
;; + Show entries in an indirect buffer by selecting that action from
;;   the Helm actions list, or by pressing `<C-return>`.
;; + The keymap for `helm-org-rifle-occur` results buffers imitates
;;   the `org-speed` keys, making it quicker to navigate. You can also
;;   collapse and expand headings and drawers with `TAB` and `S-TAB`,
;;   just like in regular Org buffers.  Results buffers are marked
;;   read-only so you cannot modify them by accidental keypresses.
;; + Delete the result at point in `helm-org-rifle-occur` buffers by
;;   pressing `d`.  This does not alter the source buffers but simply
;;   removes uninteresting results from view.
;; +  You can customize the `helm-org-rifle` group if you like.

;;; Credits:

;; This package is inspired by org-search-goto (specifically,
;; org-search-goto-ml).  Its unofficial-official home is on
;; EmacsWiki[1] but I've mirrored it on GitHub[2].  It's a really
;; great package, and the only thing that could make it better is to
;; make it work with Helm.  To avoid confusion, this package has a
;; completely different name.
