;;; Commentary:

;; How many times have you wanted to fire off a quick command, such as M-!,
;; but the directory you want to run the command in isn't the same as the
;; directory of the current buffer?  In those situations, you want a quick way
;; to change the default-directory *for only the next command*.  That is what
;; Springboard aims to solve.
;;
;; Bind it to a convenient key, like Control-., and after you press it you'll
;; see a handy Helm buffer showing the directories of all the files you've
;; recently visited, plus the permanent directory list from
;; `springboard-directories' -- a good place to list your active project
;; directories.
;;
;; Type a few chars to narrow down to the directory of interest, then just
;; type your command, like M-!, C-x C-f, or whatever custom bindings you may
;; have to run PCVS, Magit, etc.  The moment you type your command,
;; Springboard disappears, and if your command needs minibuffer input, you'll
;; now be in the minibuffer for that new command.
