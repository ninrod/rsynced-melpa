Octopress.el is a lightweight wrapper script to help you interact
with Octopress blog site and the related Jekyll programs.  This
package is designed to be unobtrusive and to defer to Octopress and
Jekyll as often as possible.

This package was built with the assumption of Octopress 3.0 and
will probably not work with previous (non-gem) versions of
Octopress.  Specifically, it expects to be able to use commands
like `octopress new post` rather than the old-style `rake
new_post[]`.

Full documentation is available as an Info manual.
