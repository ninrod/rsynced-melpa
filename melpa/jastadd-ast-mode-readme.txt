This mode provides light support for editing of JastAdd AST definition
files in Emacs.  JastAdd is a meta-compilation system that supports
Reference Attribute Grammars (RAGs); see http://jastadd.org.  Currently,
this mode supports syntax highlighting, comment support and buffer
navigation via imenu.
