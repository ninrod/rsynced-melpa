;;; 
;; A company-mode Emacs completion backend for
;; SLY, a Common Lisp IDE.
;;
;; SLY lives at https://github.com/capitaomorte/sly. company-mode
;; lives at http://company-mode.github.io.  slime-company, whereupon
;; sly-company is based, lives at https://github.com/anwyn/slime-company.
;; 
;;; Installation:
;;
;; Install via MELPA, or alternatively do the following in your
;; `~/.emacs' or `~/.emacs.d/init/el' init file.
;;  
;;     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/sly-company")
;;     (require 'sly-company)
;;  
;; In either case add this to the init file as well:
;;  
;;     (add-hook 'sly-mode-hook 'sly-company-mode)
;;     (add-to-list 'company-backends 'sly-company)
;;
;; The following bindings for `company-active-map' may be useful:
;;
;;   (define-key company-active-map (kbd "\C-n") 'company-select-next)
;;   (define-key company-active-map (kbd "\C-p") 'company-select-previous)
;;   (define-key company-active-map (kbd "\C-d") 'company-show-doc-buffer)
;;   (define-key company-active-map (kbd "M-.") 'company-show-location)
