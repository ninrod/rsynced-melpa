This package complements (does not replace) the standard whois
functionality of GNU Emacs.  It provides:

* A `whois-mode' with font-lock highlighting to make whois
  responses easier to read.

* A `whois-shell' function to make a whois query using the system
  whois program instead of Emacs' own (often not up to date) whois
  client.
