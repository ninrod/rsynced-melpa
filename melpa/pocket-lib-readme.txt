This package is based on pocket-api.el by DarkSun/lujun9972 at
<https://github.com/lujun9972/pocket-api.el>, which is based on
el-pocket by Tod Davies at <https://github.com/pterygota/el-pocket>.

It has essentially been completely written; no code remains except
`pocket-lib-default-extra-headers' a few lines in the call to
`request', and the consumer-key is currently the same.
