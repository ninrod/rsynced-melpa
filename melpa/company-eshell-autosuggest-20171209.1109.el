  "Enable fish-like autosuggestions in eshell.

You can use <right> to select the suggestion. This is
customizable through `company-eshell-autosuggest-active-map'. If
you prefer to use the default value of `company-active-map', you
may set the variable
`company-eshell-autosuggest-use-company-map', though this isn't
recommended as RET and TAB may not work as expected (send input,
trigger completions, respectively) when there is an active
suggestion.

The delay defaults to 0 seconds to emulate fish shell's
instantaneous suggestions, but is customizable with
`company-eshell-autosuggest-delay'.

Note: This assumes you want to use something other than company
for shell completion, e.g. `eshell-pcomplete',
`completion-at-point', or helm-esh-pcomplete, since
`company-active-map', `company-backends', and `company-frontends'
will be locally overriden and company will be used solely for
history autosuggestions."
