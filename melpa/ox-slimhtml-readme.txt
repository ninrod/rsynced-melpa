slimhtml is an Emacs org mode export backend.  It is a set of
transcoders for common org elements which outputs minimal
HTML.  The aim is not to re-invent the wheel over the default
org-mode HTML exporter - as it tackles a much bigger, and
different problem - but to provide a small set of components for
easier customization of HTML output from org.
