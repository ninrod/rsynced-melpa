gopher.el allows you to navigate Gopher servers.

"M-x gopher" prompts you for an address.  <TAB> and <M-TAB> navigate
between links on a directory listing, while <[> and <]> navigate
between text documents.  <RET> opens the link at the cursor's
position.  You can navigate up through the directory tree with <u>.

There is primitive history support.  <B> navigates backwards
and <F> forwards through the history.
