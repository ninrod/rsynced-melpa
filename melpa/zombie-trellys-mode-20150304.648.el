;;; Commentary:

;; This is a minor mode for interaction with Zombie - a
;; dependently-typed language that is a result of the Trellys
;; project. Due to limited time, zombie-trellys-mode is implemented as
;; a minor mode with a command for loading the current buffer's file
;; into Zombie and viewing the results. This mode inherits
;; `haskell-mode' to get a somewhat reasonable highlighting
;; experience.
;;
;; Zombie is available from https://code.google.com/p/trellys/
