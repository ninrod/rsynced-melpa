A major mode for editing OCaml code (see <http://ocaml.org/>) in Emacs.

Some of its major features include:

- syntax highlighting (font lock);
- automatic indentation;
- querying the type of expressions (using compiler generated annot files);
- running an OCaml REPL within Emacs;
- scans declarations and places them in a menu.


The original indentation code was the work of Ian T Zimmerman and
was adapted for OCaml by Jacques Garrigue in July 1997.
