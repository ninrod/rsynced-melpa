;;     (require 'window-end-visible)
;;
;;     ;; open a buffer larger than the window
;;
;;     ;; may return nil
;;     M-: (pos-visible-in-window-p (window-end)) RET
;;
;;     ;; always returns t
;;     M-: (pos-visible-in-window-p (window-end-visible)) RET
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; Window-end-visible.el has no user-level interface, and is only
;; useful when programming Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; This library provides the function `window-end-visible', which
;; works around a limitation of `window-end', at a speed penalty.
;;
;; The issue this function solves is that the following is not true
;; as might be expected:
;;
;;    (pos-visible-in-window-p (window-end))
;;
;; `window-end-visible' returns the "true" window end: the last
;; visible position in the window, verified by testing with
;; `pos-visible-in-window-p'.
;;
;; The speed penalty of `window-end-visible' over `window-end' varies
;; depending on your configuration.  For example, tabbar.el makes
;; calling `pos-visible-in-window-p' quite expensive.
;;
;; To use window-end-visible, place the window-end-visible.el library
;; somewhere Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs
;; file:
;;
;;     (require 'window-end-visible)
