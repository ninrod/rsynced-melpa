;;; Commentary:
;; A tool to quickly open a daily diary buffer.

;; Morning Pages are a concept named by Julia Cameron in her book
;; "The Artist's Way".  They are defined by the activity of waking up every
;; day and writing three pages of anything or everything that might be on
;; your mind.  The purpose is to express one's most urgent thoughts in a slightly
;; more coherent manner than they tend to occur in the realm of pure thought.
;; Unlike a "diary" they are meant to be a dumping ground, not a saving place.
;; Think it, write it, clear your mind, and move on.  Just doing that is enough.
;; In my experience of doing it daily I fret less about silly things and work
;; through my issues more productively.  I recommend it highly.

;; Opening up Emacs and running `M-x mpages' will open up an empty buffer
;; pointed at a txt file for today.  As you type it will keep track of the time
;; spent and the number of words typed.  The default, 750  words approximates
;; three written pages.  A competent typist, just letting his or her thoughts
;; flow should be able to finish between 15 and 20 minutes.  I find the effort
;; required is absolutely worth the time spent.  Enough so that I made this
;; package.  `M-x customize' has a few mpages related options under Text->mpages.


;;; Change Log:
;; 20141120 Fix counting words error when empty buffer
;; 20141030 Fix void-variable bug for Emacs 24.4
;; 20140913 Made fit for consumption
;; 20140824 First Version
