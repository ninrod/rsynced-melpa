fancy-narrow
============

Emacs package to immitate `narrow-to-region' with more eye-candy.

Unlike `narrow-to-region', which completely hides text outside
the narrowed region, this package simply deemphasizes the text,
makes it readonly, and makes it unreachable.

This leads to a much more natural feeling, where the region stays
static (instead of being brutally moved to a blank slate) and is
clearly highlighted with respect to the rest of the buffer.

Simply call `fancy-narrow-to-region' to see it in action. To widen the
region again afterwards use `fancy-widen'.

To customise the face used to deemphasize unreachable text, customise
`fancy-narrow-blocked-face'.

Note this is designed for user interaction. For using within lisp code,
the standard `narrow-to-region' is preferable, because the fancy
version is susceptible to `inhibit-read-only' and some corner cases.
