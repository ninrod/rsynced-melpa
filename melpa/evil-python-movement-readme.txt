First, I was reading about whether Neovim provided movement tools
Python that I didn't know of, when I stumbled with this:

After learning that indeed they existed, they weren't present in
Evil.  After opening an issue
https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1043
I was explained that these tools wouldn't be available through
Evil.  So, I implemented them myself.

TL;DR: this is best explained looking at https://stackoverflow.com/a/28284564
       or the unit tests (not yet availaible)
