If you ever dreamed about creating and switching buffer groups at will
in Emacs, Torus is the tool you want.

In short, this plugin let you organize your buffers by creating as
many buffer groups as you need, add the files you want to it and
quickly navigate between :

  - Buffers of the same group
  - Buffer groups
  - Workspaces, ie sets of buffer groups

Note that :

  - A location is a pair (buffer (or filename) . position)
  - A buffer group, in fact a location group, is called a circle
  - A set of buffer groups is called a torus (a circle of circles)
