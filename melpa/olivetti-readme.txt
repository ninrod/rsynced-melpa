# Olivetti #

A simple Emacs minor mode for a nice writing environment.

## Features ##

- Set a desired text body width to automatically resize window margins to
  keep the text comfortably in the middle of the window.
- Text body width can be the number of characters (an integer) or a fraction
  of the window width (a float between 0.0 and 1.0).
- Interactively change body width with:
  olivetti-shrink C-c { { { ...
  olivetti-expand C-c } } } ...
  olivetti-set-width C-c \
- If olivetti-body-width is an integer, the text body width will scale with
  use of text-scale-mode, whereas if a fraction (float) then the text body
  width will remain at that fraction.
- Optionally remember the state of visual-line-mode on entry and recall its
  state on exit.

Olivetti keeps everything it does buffer-local, so you can write prose in one
buffer and code in another, side-by-side in the same frame. For those looking
for a hardcore distraction-free writing mode with a much larger scope, I
recommend writeroom-mode: https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode.
