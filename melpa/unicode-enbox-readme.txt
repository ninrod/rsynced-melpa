Quickstart

    (require 'unicode-enbox)

    (insert "\n" (unicode-enbox "testing"))

Explanation

Unicode-enbox.el has no user-level interface; it is only useful
for programming in Emacs Lisp.

This library provides two functions:

    unicode-enbox
    unicode-enbox-debox

which can be used to add/remove box-drawing characters around
a single- or multi-line string.

To use unicode-enbox, place the unicode-enbox.el library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'unicode-enbox)

See Also

    M-x customize-group RET unicode-enbox RET

Notes

For good monospaced box-drawing characters, it is recommended to
install the free DejaVu Sans Mono font and use unicode-fonts.el.
If unicode-fonts.el is too heavy for your needs, try adding the
following bit to your ~/.emacs file:

    (set-fontset-font "fontset-default"
                      (cons (decode-char 'ucs #x2500)  (decode-char 'ucs #x257F))
                      '("DejaVu Sans Mono" . "iso10646-1"))

Bugs

TODO

    Interactive command that works on rectangles.

    Logic in unicode-enbox is not clear, eg where it falls through
    to 'smart.

    Detect lines of full dashes, replace with box chars and
    connectors, then would need more clever deboxing - or just
    store the original string in a property - done?

    Detect acutal width of unicode characters in GUI - char-width
    does not return the right answer.

    Generalize to comment boxes with multi-character drawing
    elements.
