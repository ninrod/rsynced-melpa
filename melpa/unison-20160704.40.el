;;; Commentary:

;; Simple wrappers for running Unison to sync things; handy for
;; putting into midnight-hook's or similar.

;; To use, first set `unison-args' to the arguments you'd normally
;; call unison with (Unison won't do ), then call M-x unison (or put
;; #'unison into a hook).

;;; Code:

(defgroup unison nil
  "For syncing files with Unison"
  :tag "unison"
  :group 'communication)

(defcustom unison-sentinel-hook nil
  "Run by `unison' on process state change.
Same arguments as expected by `set-process-sentinel'."
  :group 'unison
  :type 'function)

(defcustom unison-program "unison"
  "Path to the Unison binary."
  :group 'unison
  :type 'string)

(defcustom unison-args nil
  "Arguments sent to Unison."
  :group 'unison
  :type '(repeat string))
