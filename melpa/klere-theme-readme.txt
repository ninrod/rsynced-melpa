I haven't seen all themes out there, I'm sure, but it seems most users
prefer – what look like, to me – washed out colors. In some cases, some
themes have stated that was their point, that contrasting colors are
harder on the eyes. But call me a slave to the asthetic but I wanted a
dark theme with radiant colors that seem to shine against the dark
backgrounds; I dunno if I quite achieved that but it's the color scheme
I've found myself most liking so I'm pleased with it. Options are
great so everyone gets what they like so here's it for you to try.
