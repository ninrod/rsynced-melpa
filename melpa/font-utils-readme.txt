Quickstart

    (require 'font-utils)

    (font-utils-exists-p "Courier")

Explanation

Font-utils is a collection of functions for working with fonts.
This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful
for programming in Emacs Lisp.

The following functions are provided, most of which deal with
font names rather than font objects:

    `font-utils-exists-p'
    `font-utils-first-existing-font'
    `font-utils-is-qualified-variant'
    `font-utils-lenient-name-equal'
    `font-utils-list-names'
    `font-utils-name-from-xlfd'
    `font-utils-normalize-name'
    `font-utils-parse-name'
    `font-utils-read-name'

The most generally useful of these is `font-utils-exists-p', which
tests whether a font matching the given name is currently available
for use.

To use font-utils, place the font-utils.el library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'font-utils)

    M-x customize-group RET font-utils RET

    Uses if present: persistent-soft.el (Recommended)

Bugs

    Behavior/echo messages are not sane when font-utils-use-memory-cache
    is nil, or pcache is not available.

    Checking for font availability is slow on most systems.
    Workaround: where supported, font information will be cached
    to disk.  See customize for more.

    font-utils-exists-p only supports two styles of font
    name.  This page

        http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Fonts.html#Fonts

    describes four styles of font name.

TODO

    Better support for disabling caching.

    Possibly return a font object instead of font-info vector
    from font-utils-exists-p.

    Test whether (find-font (font-spec :name "Name")) is faster
    than font-info.

    font-utils-create-fuzzy-matches is not exhaustive enough
    to catch many typos.
