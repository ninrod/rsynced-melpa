;;; Commentary:

;; Hyperspace is a way to get nearly anywhere from wherever you are,
;; whether that's within Emacs or on the web.  It's somewhere in
;; between Quicksilver and keyword URLs, giving you a single,
;; consistent interface to get directly where you want to go.  It’s
;; for things that you use often, but not often enough to justify a
;; dedicated binding.
;;
;; When you enter Hyperspace, it prompts you where to go:
;;
;; HS:
;;
;; This prompt expects a keyword and a query.  The keyword picks where
;; you want to go, and the remainder of the input is an optional
;; argument which can be used to further search or direct you within
;; that space.
;;
;; Some concrete examples:
;;
;; | *If you enter*   | *then Hyperspace*                                        |
;; |------------------+----------------------------------------------------------|

;; | "el eval-region" | searches for "eval-region" in the elisp Info index       |
;; | "bb"             | shows all BBDB entries                                   |
