This library implements an RFC (xml2rfc) export back-end for Org. It
exports into XML as defined in RFC7749 (v2) and RFC7991 (v3), and can
also use `xml2rfc` directly to further convert to HTML, PDF and TXT.
See Org manual for more information. See README.org
(https://github.com/choppsv1/org-rfc-export/blob/master/README.org)
for basic documentation on use.
