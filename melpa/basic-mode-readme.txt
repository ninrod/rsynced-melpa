This package provides a major mode for editing BASIC code,
including syntax highlighting and indentation.

You can format the region, or the entire buffer, by typing C-c C-f.

Installation:

The easiest way to install basic-mode is from MELPA, please see
https://melpa.org.

To install manually, place basic-mode.el in your load-path, and add
the following lines of code to your init file:

(autoload 'basic-mode "basic-mode" "Major mode for editing BASIC code." t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.bas\\'" . basic-mode))

Configuration:

You can customize the indentation of code blocks, see variable
`basic-indent-offset'. The default value is 4.

You can also customize the number of columns to use for line
numbers, see variable `basic-line-number-cols'. The default value
is 0, which means not using line numbers at all.

Formatting is also affected by the customizable variables
`basic-delete-trailing-whitespace' and `delete-trailing-lines'
(from simple.el).
