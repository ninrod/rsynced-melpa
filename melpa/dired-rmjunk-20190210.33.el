;;; Commentary:

;; dired-rmjunk is a port of Jakub Klinkovsk√Ω's home directory cleanup tool to
;; Dired. The interactive function, `dired-rmjunk' will mark all files in the
;; current Dired buffer that match one of the patterns specified in
;; `dired-rmjunk-patterns'. The tool is intended as a simple means for
;; keeping one's home directory tidy -- removing "junk" dotfiles.

;; The script that this is based on can be found at:
;; <https://github.com/lahwaacz/Scripts/blob/master/rmshit.py>
