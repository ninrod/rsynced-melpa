This package adds commands that allow the user to quickly and intuitively
wrap a desired amount of text within delimiters, including parentheses and
quotes.  After calling one of the interactive commands, repeated calls will
shift the corral instead of inserting new delimiters, expanding the amount
of text contained within the delimiters.
