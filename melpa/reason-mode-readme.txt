This project provides useful functions and helpers for developing code
using the Reason programming language (https://facebook.github.io/reason).

Reason is an umbrella project that provides a curated layer for OCaml.

It offers:
 - A new, familiar syntax for the battle-tested language that is OCaml.
 - A workflow for compiling to JavaScript and native code.
 - A set of friendly documentations, libraries and utilities.

See the README.md for more details.
