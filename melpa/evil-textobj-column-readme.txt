This package is a port of the vim textobj-word-column plugin. It provides a
a means to create text objects for acting on a column whose width is
determined by motions. The default text objects are for columns having the
width of an evil word or WORD (big word). This can be a convenient way to
start a visual block selection, for example.

For more information see the README in the github repo.
