;;; Commentary:

;; Based in part on http://d.hatena.ne.jp/antipop/20110508/1304838383
;;
;; Usage:
;;   (require 'flymake-coffee)
;;   (add-hook 'coffee-mode-hook 'flymake-coffee-load)
;;
;; Executes "coffeelint" if available, otherwise "coffee".
;;
;; Uses flymake-easy, from https://github.com/purcell/flymake-easy

;;; Code:

(require 'flymake-easy)
;; Doesn't strictly require coffee-mode, but will use 'coffee-command if set

  :prefix "flymake-coffee-"
