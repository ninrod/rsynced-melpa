Major mode for editing .env files (which are used for storing
environment variables).

Usage:

(require 'dotenv-mode) ; unless installed from a package
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.env\\..*\\'" . dotenv-mode)) ;; for optionally supporting additional file extensions such as `.env.test' with this major mode
