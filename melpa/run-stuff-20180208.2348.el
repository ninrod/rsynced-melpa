;;; Commentary:

;; Run commands from the region or current line,
;; with some simple specifiers to control behavior.

;;; Usage

;; (run-stuff-command-on-region-or-line)
;;
;; A command to execute the current selection or the current line.
;; 
;; - '$ ' Run in terminal.
;; - '@ ' Open in an Emacs buffer.
;; - '~ ' Open with default mime type (works for paths too).
;; - 'http://' or 'https://' opens in a web-browser.
;; - Open in terminal if its a directory.
;; - Default to running the command without a terminal
;;   when none of the conditions above succeed.
;;
;; Note that there is support for line splitting,
;; so long commands may be split over multiple lines.
;; This is done using the '\' character, when executing the current line
;; all surrounding lines which end with '\' will be included.
;;
;; So you can for define a shell command as follows:
;;
;; $ make \
;;   -C /my/project \
;;   --no-print-directory \
;;   --keep-going
;;
;; The entire block will be detected so you can run the command
;; with your cursor over any of these lines, without needing to move to the first.
