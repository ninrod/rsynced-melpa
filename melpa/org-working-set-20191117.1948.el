;;; Commentary:

;; Purpose:
;;
;;  Maintain a small and changing subset of your org-nodes to visit with ease.
;;
;;  The working-set is a small set of nodes, among which you can switch
;;  rapidly; it is expected to change on a daily or even hourly basis.  Put
;;  nodes into your working set in order to return easily after any
;;  interruption.
;;
;;  Once you have added nodes to your working set, there are two ways to
;;  traverse them (both are accessible through the central function
;;  `org-working-set'): cycling through your working set is the quickest
;;  way to return to the current node or go to others; alternatively,
;;  invoking the working set menu allows for better control but may require
;;  more keystrokes.
;;  
;;  Please note, that org-working-set adds an id-property to all nodes in
;;  the working-set.
;;
;;  The list of ids from the nodes of your working-set is stored within the
;;  property-drawer of a distinguished node specified via
;;  `org-working-set-id'; this can be any node you choose and is itself not
;;  part of the working-set.
;;
;;  Remark: Depending on your needs you might also find these packages
;;  interesting for providing somewhat similar functionality: org-now and
;;  org-mru-clock.
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;  - org-working-set can be installed with package.el
;;  - Invoke `org-working-set', it will explain and assist you to set the
;;    customizable variable `org-working-set-id'
;;

;;; Change Log:

;;   Version 1.1
;;
;;   - Moved functions for working set into its own file
;;   - Show breadcrumbs in working-set-menu
;;   - Prepare for melpa
;;
;;  See the package org-index for older news

  "Maintain a small and changing subset of your org-nodes to visit with ease.

The working-set is a small set of nodes, among which you can switch
rapidly; it is expected to change on a daily or even hourly basis.  Put
nodes into your working set in order to return easily after any
interruption.

Once you have added nodes to your working set, there are two ways to
traverse them (both are accessible through the central function
`org-working-set'): cycling through your working set is the quickest
way to return to the current node or go to others; alternatively,
invoking the working set menu allows for better control but may require
more keystrokes.

Please note, that org-working-set adds an id-property to all nodes in
the working-set.

The list of ids from the nodes of your working-set is stored within the
property-drawer of a distinguished node specified via
`org-working-set-id'; this can be any node you choose and is itself not
part of the working-set.

Remark: Depending on your needs you might also find these packages
interesting for providing somewhat similar functionality: org-now and
org-mru-clock.

This is version 1.0.4 of org-working-set.el.

The subcommands allow to:
- Modify the list of nodes (e.g. add new nodes)
- Circle quickly through the nodes
- Show a menu buffer with all nodes currently in the working set

Optional argument SILENT does not issue final message."
