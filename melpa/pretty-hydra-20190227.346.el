  "Define a pretty hydra with given NAME, BODY options and HEADS-PLIST.
The generated hydra has a nice-looking docstring which is a table
with columns of command keys and hints.

NAME should be a symbol and is passed to `defhydra' as is.

BODY is the same as that in `defhydra', withe the following
pretty hydra specific ones:

  - `:separator' a single char used to generate the separator
    line.

  - `:title' a string that's added to the beginning of the
    docstring as a title of the hydra.

  - `:formatter' a function that takes the generated docstring
    and return a decorated one.  It can be used to further
    customize the hydra docstring.

  - `:quit-key' a key for quitting the hydra.  When specified, an
    invisible head is created with this key for quitting the
    hydra.

HEADS-PLIST is a plist of columns of hydra heads.  The keys of
the plist should be column names.  The values should be lists of
hydra heads.  Each head has exactly the same syntax as that of
`defhydra', except hint is required for the head to appear in the
docstring."
