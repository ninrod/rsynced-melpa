;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Add support for composer/installers to ede-php-autoload.
;;
;; Allows ede-php-autoload to find classes even if composer/installers
;; has relocated the package.
;;
;; Customize `ede-php-autoload-composer-installers-project-paths' to
;; specify the default installation path for package types, when not
;; specified in the extra section of composer.json.
;;
