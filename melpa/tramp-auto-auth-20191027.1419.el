;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides ‘tramp-auto-auth-mode’: a global minor mode
;; whose purpose is to automatically feed TRAMP sub-processes with
;; passwords for paths matching regexps.  This is useful in situations
;; where interactive user input is not desirable or feasible.  For
;; instance, in sub-nets with large number of hosts or whose hosts
;; have dynamic IPs assigned to them.  In those cases it’s not
;; practical to query passwords using the ‘auth-source’ library
;; directly, since this would require each host to be listed
;; explicitly and immutably in a Netrc file.  Another scenario where
;; this mode is useful are non-interactive Emacs sessions (like those
;; used for batch processing or by evaluating ‘:async’ Org Babel
;; source blocks) in which it’s impossible for the user to answer a
;; password-asking prompt.
;;
;; When a TRAMP prompt is encountered, ‘tramp-auto-auth-mode’ queries
;; the alist ‘tramp-auto-auth-alist’ for the auth-source spec value
;; whose regexp key matches the correspondent TRAMP path.  This spec
;; is then used to query the auth-source library for a presumably
;; phony entry exclusively dedicated to the whole class of TRAMP
;; paths matching that regexp.
;;
;; To make use of the automatic authentication feature, on the Lisp
;; side the variable ‘tramp-auto-auth-alist’ must be customized to
;; hold the path regexps and their respective auth-source specs, and
;; then ‘tramp-auto-auth-mode’ must be enabled.  For example:
;;
;; ---- ~/.emacs.el -------------------------------------------------
;; (require 'tramp-auto-auth)
;;
;; (add-to-list
;;  'tramp-auto-auth-alist
;;  '("root@10\\.0\\." .
;;    (:host "Funny-Machines" :user "root" :port "ssh")))
;;
;; (tramp-auto-auth-mode)
;; ------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; After this, just put the respective sacred secret in an
;; authentication source supported by auth-source library.  For
;; instance:
;;
;; ---- ~/.authinfo.gpg ---------------------------------------------
;; machine Funny-Machines login root password "$r00tP#sWD!" port ssh
;; ------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; In case you are feeling lazy or the secret is not so secret (nor so
;; sacred) -- or for any reason you need to do it all from Lisp --
;; it’s enough to:
;;
;; (auth-source-remember '(:host "Funny-Machines" :user "root" :port "ssh")
;; 		         '((:secret "$r00tP#sWD!")))
;;
;; And happy TRAMPing!
