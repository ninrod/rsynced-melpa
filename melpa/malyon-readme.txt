This package provides a basic interpreter for version 3, 5, 8 Z-code
story files as generated by Inform (C) Graham Nelson and Infocom.

If you encounter a bug please send a report to Peter Ilberg at
peter.ilberg@gmail.com. Thank you!

To play a story file simply type M-x malyon and enter the path to the
story file. If anything goes wrong and you want to manually clean
up type M-x malyon-quit. In addition, you can switch back to a game in
progress by typing M-x malyon-restore.

A note on the format of saved game states:

As of version 1.0, Malyon supports the quetzal file format for saved
games. Support for this format required changes to several internal
data structures (stack frames and catch-throw) that are incompatible
with the old implementation. Unfortunately, the old file format for
saved games cannot be converted into quetzal.

For backwards compatibility, however, Malyon still supports the old
file format. And you can continue to play your old game states.

Because of the incompatibility of the two file formats, Malyon now
runs, as follows, in either of two modes: quetzal and compatibility.

- in quetzal mode, game states are saved in quetzal format
- in compatibility mode, games states are saved in the old format
- loading a game state in quetzal format switches to quetzal mode
- loading an old game state switches to compatibility mode
- quetzal mode is the default setting

In other words, Malyon will only use the old file format if you've
restored a game state saved in the old file format.

Enjoy!
