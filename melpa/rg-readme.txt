A search package based on the ripgrep command line tool.
It allows you to interactively create searches, doing automatic
searches based on the editing context, refining and modifying
search results and much more.  It is also highly configurable to be
able to fit different users' needs.

If you are used to built-in Emacs rgrep command, transitioning to
rg should be simple.  rg provides a lot of extra features
but the basics are similar.

The big benefit of using ripgrep instead of grep as a backend is
speed.  Especially when searching large source code repositories
where ripgrep really shines.
