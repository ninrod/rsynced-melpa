;;; Commentary:

;; To espy is to see something at a distance which is what this package is about.
;; This package allows users to fetch a  user and password from a file
;; without visiting it. It gathers all headers containing passwords or
;; usernames as defined by `espy-header-prefix' and `espy-pass-prefix' and
;; presents them to the user. The choosen password gets added to the kill ring.
;;
;; For example using a file with the content of
;; (with no whitespace before any prefix)
;;
;;    *** Header1
;;    user: User1
;;    pass: Password1
;;
;; and running
;;
;;    (espy-get-pass)
;;
;; would result in one entry `Header1' being selectable. Choosing this entry
;; would result in `Password1' being copied to the kill-ring
