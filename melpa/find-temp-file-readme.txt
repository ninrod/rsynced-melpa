This library allows you to open quickly a temporary file of a given
extension. No need to specify a name, just an extension.

Installation:

Just put this file in your load path and require it:
(require 'find-temp-file)

You may want to bind `find-temp-file' to a convenient keystroke. In
my setup, I bind it to "C-x C-t".
