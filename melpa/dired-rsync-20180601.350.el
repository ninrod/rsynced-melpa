;;; Commentary:
;;
;; dired-rsync is a command that can be run from a dired buffer to
;; copy files using rsync rather than tramps in-built mechanism.
;; This is especially useful for copying large files to/from remote
;; locations without locking up tramp.
;;
;; To use simply open a dired buffer, mark some files and invoke
;; dired-rsync.  After being prompted for a location to copy to an
;; inferior rsync process will be spawned.
;;
;; Wherever the files are selected from the rsync will always run from
;; your local machine.
