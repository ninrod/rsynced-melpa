This is a mode for the Chapel programming language under
development by Cray Inc.  The mode itself was originally developed
by Steven T Balensiefer at UW as part of his course project for
CSE590o, based on the derived-mode-ex.el code supported with the
standard cc-mode.

Note: The interface used in this file requires CC Mode 5.30 or
later.
