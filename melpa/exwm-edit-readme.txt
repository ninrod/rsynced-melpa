Similar to atomic-chrome https://github.com/alpha22jp/atomic-chrome
except this package is made to work with EXWM https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm
and it works with any editable element of any app

The idea is very simple - when you press the keybinding,
it simulates [C-a (select all) + C-c (copy)],
then opens a buffer and yanks (pastes) the content so you can edit it,
after you done - it grabs (now edited text) and pastes back to where it's started
