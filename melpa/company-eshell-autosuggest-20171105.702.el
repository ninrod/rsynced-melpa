;;; Commentary:

;; Provides a company backend that implements functionality similar to fish
;; shell history autosuggestions.

;;; Code:

(require 'company)
(require 'cl-lib)

(defun company-eshell-autosuggest-candidates (prefix)
  "Select the first eshell history candidate with prefix PREFIX."
  (let* ((history
          (delete-dups
           (mapcar (lambda (str)
                     (string-trim (substring-no-properties str)))
                   (ring-elements eshell-history-ring))))
         (most-similar (cl-find-if
                        (lambda (str)
                          (string-prefix-p prefix str))
                        history)))
    (when most-similar
      `(,most-similar))))
