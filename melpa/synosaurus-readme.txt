An extensible thesaurus supporting lookup and substitution.

You can choose between multiple backends. Current backends include
wordnet and openthesaurus, but it's easy to add your own.

Use `synosaurus-lookup' for lookup and `synosaurus-choose-and-replace'
to replace the word under cursor.

Customization can be done by M-x customize-group synosaurus
