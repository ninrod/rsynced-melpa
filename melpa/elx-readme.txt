This package extracts information from Emacs Lisp libraries.  It
extends built-in `lisp-mnt', which is only suitable for libraries
that closely follow the header conventions.  Unfortunately there
are many libraries that do not - this library tries to cope with
that.

It also defines some new extractors not available in `lisp-mnt',
and some generalizations of extractors available in the latter.
