This file provides a single function, `scheme-smart-complete',
which you can use for intelligent, context-sensitive completion
for any Scheme implementation.  To use it just load this file and
bind that function to a key in your preferred mode:

(autoload 'scheme-smart-complete "scheme-complete" nil t)
(eval-after-load 'scheme
  '(define-key scheme-mode-map "\e\t" 'scheme-smart-complete))

Alternately, you may want to just bind TAB to the
`scheme-complete-or-indent' function, which indents at the start
of a line and otherwise performs the smart completion:

(eval-after-load 'scheme
  '(define-key scheme-mode-map "\t" 'scheme-complete-or-indent))

  Note: the completion uses a somewhat less common style than
  typically found in other modes.  The first tab will complete the
  longest prefix common to all possible completions.  The second
  tab will show a list of those completions.  Subsequent tabs will
  scroll that list.  You can't use the mouse to select from the
  list - when you see what you want, just type the next one or
  more characters in the symbol you want and hit tab again to
  continue completing it.  Any key typed will bury the completion
  list.  This ensures you can achieve a completion with the
  minimal number of keystrokes without the completions window
  lingering and taking up space.

If you use eldoc-mode (included in Emacs), you can also get live
scheme documentation with:

(autoload 'scheme-get-current-symbol-info "scheme-complete" nil t)
(add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook
  (lambda ()
    (make-local-variable 'eldoc-documentation-function)
    (setq eldoc-documentation-function 'scheme-get-current-symbol-info)
    (eldoc-mode)))

You can enable slightly smarter indentation with

(setq lisp-indent-function 'scheme-smart-indent-function)

which basically ignores the scheme-indent-function property for
locally overridden symbols (e.g. if you use the (let loop () ...)
idiom it won't use the special loop indentation inside).

There's a single custom variable, `scheme-default-implementation',
which you can use to specify your preferred implementation when we
can't infer it from the source code.

That's all there is to it.
