This package advises help functions that find code.  Each function
is advised to open org babel-files to the appropriate source-block
instead of tangled-code.

Opening the org file instead of the tangled code has the advantage
of allowing instantaneous code changes, as well as providing
whatever additional information is contained in the org file to the
user.
