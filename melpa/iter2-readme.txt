Fully compatible fast reimplementation `generator' built-in Emacs
package.  The package provides `iter2-defun` and `iter2-lambda`
forms that can be used instead of `iter-defun` and `iter-lambda`.
All other functions and macros (e.g. `iter-yield`, `iter-next`) are
intentionally not duplicated: just use the original ones.
