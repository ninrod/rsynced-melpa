Fully compatible fast reimplementation of `generator' built-in
Emacs package.  This library provides `iter2-defun` and
`iter2-lambda` forms that can be used in place of `iter-defun` and
`iter-lambda`.  All other functions and macros (e.g. `iter-yield`,
`iter-next`) are intentionally not duplicated: just use the
original ones.
