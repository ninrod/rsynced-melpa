;;; wn-mode.el --- numeric window switching shortcuts -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; URL: https://github.com/luismbo/wn-mode
;; Package-Version: 20151109.2152
;; Author: Anonymous
;; Maintainer: Lu√≠s Oliveira <luismbo@gmail.com>
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24"))
;; Keywords: buffers windows switching-windows

;; This library was found at the Emacs Wiki and is probably in the
;; public domain.

;;; Commentary:

;; This library defines a global minor mode called `wn-mode' that adds
;; keyboard shortcuts to quickly switch between visible windows within
;; the current Emacs frame.
;;
;; To activate, simply add
;;   (wn-mode)
;; to your `~/.emacs'.
;;
;; By default, the shortcuts are M-1, ..., M-9 for selecting windows
;; #1 through #9. M-0 selects the minibuffer, if active. M-#
;; interactively asks which window to select.
;;
;; With a prefix argument, swaps the buffers between the current and
;; the target windows.
;;
;; Customize `wn-keybinding-format' if you wish to use different key
;; bindings, e.g.:
;;   (setq wn-keybinding-format "C-c %s")
;;
;; Re-enable `wn-mode' and the new keybindings will take effect.
