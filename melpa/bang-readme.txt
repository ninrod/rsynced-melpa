Bang is a interactive `shell-command' substitute, that extends the
regular Emacs function by considering the first character as special.
Read `bang's docstring for more details.

This version of Bang has been based on Leah Neukirchen's version, and
has been (messily) extended to handle history commands (!32 for the
32'nd last command, !xterm for the last command starting with xterm).
Most of the internal code of `bang' has been rewritten for this sake.

The original version can be found here:
