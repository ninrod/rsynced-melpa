;;; Commentary:

;; `eve-mode` is a major mode for editing [Eve Documents][1] built on
;; top of `polymode`.  Since Eve blocks (analagous to DB queries) are
;; conventionally embedded in markdown documents, markdown mode is
;; used as the host mode and code blocks are treated as executable eve
;; blocks.  If the fenced code block has an `info string` with a value
;; other than "eve", the code block will be ignored.  It currently has
;; support for syntax highlighting and simple indentation.  Support
;; will be added for syntax and build error reporting once the new
;; language service is written.

;;; Documentation:

;; `eve-mode` adds itself to the `auto-mode-alist` for `.eve` files
;; automatically.  If you'd like to use eve-mode in a document with
;; another extension, use `M-x eve-mode`.
