;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package makes it easy to work with quilt patches on a
;; repository When installed, the files under directory with quilt
;; patches will open as read only.  Users have to invoke `quilt-add`
;; command to edit the file and add it to the current patcheset.
;;
;; Provides M-x commands: quilt-push, quilt-push-all, quilt-pop,
;; quilt-pop-all, quilt-goto, quilt-top, quilt-find-file,
;; quilt-files, quilt-import, quilt-diff, quilt-new, quilt-applied,
;; quilt-add, quilt-edit-patch, quilt-patches, quilt-unapplied,
;; quilt-refresh, quilt-remove, quilt-edit-series, quilt-mode
;; 
;; Quilt manages a series of patches by keeping track of the changes
;; each of them makes.  They are logically organized as a stack, and
;; you can apply, un-apply, refresh them easily by traveling into the
;; stack (push/pop).
