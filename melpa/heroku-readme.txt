Enhance Heroku `run' and `pg:psql' commands with Emacs equivalents.

Requires `heroku' command-line client to be installed; this simply
shells out and wraps it in a nicer interface. See
https://toolbelt.herokuapp.com for installation instructions.

Install this via M-x package-install-file or from Marmalade:
