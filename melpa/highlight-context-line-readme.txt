This minor mode highlights the last visible line when scrolling
full windows.  It was inspired by the postscript viewer gv which
does a similar thing using a line across the screen.  It honours the
variable next-screen-context-lines.

Enable it for the current session with
    M-x highlight-context-line-mode
or permanently by putting
    (highlight-context-line-mode 1)
in your init file.
