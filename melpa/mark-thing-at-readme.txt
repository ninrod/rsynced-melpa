This package tracks and creates bindings for region marking functions found in
`thingatpt'.  The library adds on functionality that:
* Generates functions that marks *things* (per the parlance of `thingatpt.el`
  library.
* Creates a mode-map and bindings to make it easy to mark (create a region
  around) a word, URL, file, number, symbol etc (see the [usage](#usage)
  section).
* Adds a *number thing*, which allows for traversing and marking numbers.
