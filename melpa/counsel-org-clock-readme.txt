This library provides the following two commands via Ivy interface:

- `counsel-org-clock-context' displays the currently clocked task as well as
  its ancestors and descendants. If there is no currently running clock,
  this function behaves the same as `counsel-org-clock-history'.
- `counsel-org-clock-history' displays entries in `org-clock-history'
  variable.
