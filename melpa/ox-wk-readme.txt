This library implements a Wiki back-end (dokuwiki and creole flavours) for
Org exporter, based on `html' back-end.  I have started based on Markdown
backend and it deserves to be mentioned here for this reason.

It provides two commands for export, depending on the desired
output: `ox-wk-export-as-wiki' (temporary buffer) and
`ox-wk-export-to-wiki' ("txt" file).
