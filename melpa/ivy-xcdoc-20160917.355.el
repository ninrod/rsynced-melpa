;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides functions to search Xcode documents within Emacs,
;; Currently support API search only, result topics will show in web browser.
;; Other features may be added later.
;;
;; Example usage:
;;
;;   (require 'ivy-xcdoc)
;;
;; Then:
;;
;;   M-x `ivy-xcdoc-search-api' RET
;;
;; or
;;
;;   M-x `ivy-xcdoc-search-api-at-point' RET
;;
;; Tips:
;;
;; You may want to customization `ivy-xcdoc-docsets', default settings is
;; known to work with Xcode 8.0,  for other verison  the docset paths
;; maybe different, and the default settings contains OSX and iOS documents
;; only, whatchOS and tvOS is not include by default.
;;
;; You can also set the `ivy-xcdoc-url-browser-function' variable to change
;; the default display style, for example use an external browser.
