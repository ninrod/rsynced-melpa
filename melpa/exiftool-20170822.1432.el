;;; Commentary:
;;
;; exiftool.el is an elisp wrapper around ExifTool.  ExifTool supports
;; reading and writing metadata in various formats including EXIF, XMP
;; and IPTC.
;;
;; There is a significant overhead in loading ExifTool for every
;; command to be exected.  So, exiftool.el starts an ExifTool process
;; in the -stay_open mode, and passes all commands to it.  For more
;; about ExifTool's -stay_open mode, see
;; http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/#performance
