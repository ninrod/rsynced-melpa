;;; Commentary:

;; Defines a minor mode `narrow-reindent-mode' that reindents the region
;; narrowed to. The region is then indented again after widening the buffer.

;;; Code:

(defvar-local narrow-reindent--point-min 0)
(defvar-local narrow-reindent--point-max 0)
(defvar-local narrow-reindent--indent-amount 0)

  "Toggle Narrow-Reindent mode.

When Narrow-Reindent mode is active, after narrowing the buffer
is re-indented. Before widening, this narrowed region is
re-indented again. This mode uses the `indent-region' to perform
indentation."
