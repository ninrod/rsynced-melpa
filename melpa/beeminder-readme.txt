beeminder.el provides a simple way for Emacs to interact with the Beeminder
API.  It's pretty basic at the moment, but can be used to fetch and submit
data.

Please set `beeminder-username' and `beeminder-auth-token' before using.

You can find your auth token by logging in to Beeminder and then visiting the
following URI: https://www.beeminder.com/api/v1/auth_token.json

Load beeminder.el with (require 'beeminder) after your Org is set up.

Keyboard bindings:

We recommend binding the commands to the C-c b prefix

C-c b g    - Insert your goals as an org-mode list
C-c b m    - Display username in message line

You can use C-c C-x p (org-set-property) to add the beeminder
property to projects or tasks that are associated with beeminder
goals.  Set it to the identifier of your goal (the short name that's
in the URL).

By default, completing those tasks will log one point.  You can set
the beeminder-value property to "prompt" in order to interactively
specify the value whenever you complete the task.  Set
beeminder-value to "time-today" in order to log the time you
clocked today (see "Clocking work time" in the Org manual).

To do so, add these to your init.el:

(global-set-key "\C-cba" 'beeminder-add-data)
(global-set-key "\C-cbw" 'beeminder-whoami)
(global-set-key "\C-cbg" 'beeminder-my-goals-org)
(global-set-key "\C-cbr" 'beeminder-refresh-goal)
