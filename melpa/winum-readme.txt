Window numbers for Emacs: Navigate your windows and frames using numbers.

This package is an extended and actively maintained version of the
https://github.com/nschum/window-numbering.el package by Nikolaj Schumacher,
with some ideas and code taken from https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window.

This version brings, among other things, support for number sets across multiple
frames, giving the user a smoother experience of multi-screen Emacs.
