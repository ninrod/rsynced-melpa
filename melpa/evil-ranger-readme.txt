This is a minor mode that runs within dired emulating many of the features of
ranger. This minor mode shows a stack of the parent directories and updates the
parent buffers while nvaigating the file system. The preview window takes some
of the ideas from [Peep-Dired][https://github.com/asok/peep-dired] to display
previews for selected files in the primary dired buffer.
