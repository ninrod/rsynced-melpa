start-menu is a little tool that will add a "Start" menu in the menu bar
You can use the Start menu to executing external program just like the start menu in windows.

Quick start:

If you are using debian linux or ubuntu linux just M-x `start-menu-enable'
Otherwise, you should config `start-menu-menu-conf' first then M-x `start-menu-enable'
For Windows user: Sine the path to program often contains space, so may be you use "" to quote the path
If you don't need Start menu any more,just M-x start-menu-disable
Since many user hidden the menu bar, so there is also a command `start-menu-popup' which will pop up the start menu.
