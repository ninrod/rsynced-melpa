This library adds timetracking and invoice generation to org-mode
and relies heavily on
org clocking http://orgmode.org/org.html#Clocking-work-time
and TODO items http://orgmode.org/org.html#TODO-Items
and org spreadsheets http://orgmode.org/org.html#The-spreadsheet

This library attempts to conform to packaging conventions:
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Packaging.html
Bugs, enhancements welcome!
