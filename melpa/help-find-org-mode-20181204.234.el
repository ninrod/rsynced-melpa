;;; Commentary:

;; This package advises help functions that find code.  Each function
;; is advised to open org babel-files to the appropriate source-block
;; instead of tangled-code.

;; Opening the org file instead of the tangled code has the advantage
;; of allowing instantaneous code changes, as well as providing
;; whatever additional information is contained in the org file to the
;; user.

;;; Usage:

;; with `use-package:

;; (use-package help-find-org-mode
;;   :ensure t
;;   :pin melpa-stable
;;   :config (help-find-org-mode t))

;; - or -

;; (require 'help-find-org-mode)

;; along with one of the following:

;; (help-find-org-mode t)
;;    or invoke it interactively with
;; M-x help-find-org-mode

;; Note that for this package to work, org source code needs to bt
;; tangled with certain flags. The only non-default flag that needs to
;; be set is ':comments link'.

;; The below code defines an easy template that inserts a source block
;; with linked comments that is tangled to the default file:

;; (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
;; 	     '("S"
;; 	       "#+BEGIN_SRC ? :comments link :tangle yes\n\n#+END_SRC"
;; 	       "<src lang=\"?\">\n\n</src>"))

;; expand it by inserting "<S" and hitting

;;; TODO:
;; - don't find the .el file also (kill it if it wasn't open before,
;;   bury if it was open but not visible)
