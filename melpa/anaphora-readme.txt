Quickstart

    (require 'anaphora)

    (awhen (big-long-calculation)
      (foo it)      ; `it' is provided as
      (bar it))     ; a temporary variable

    ;; anonymous function to compute factorial using `self'
    (alambda (x) (if (= x 0) 1 (* x (self (1- x)))))

    ;; to fontify `it' and `self'
    (with-eval-after-load "lisp-mode"
      (anaphora-install-font-lock-keywords))

Explanation

Anaphoric expressions implicitly create one or more temporary
variables which can be referred to during the expression.  This
technique can improve clarity in certain cases.  It also enables
recursion for anonymous functions.

To use anaphora, place the anaphora.el library somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'anaphora)

The following macros are made available

    `aand'
    `ablock'
    `acase'
    `acond'
    `aecase'
    `aetypecase'
    `aif'
    `alambda'
    `alet'
    `aprog1'
    `aprog2'
    `atypecase'
    `awhen'
    `awhile'
    `a+'
    `a-'
    `a*'
    `a/'
