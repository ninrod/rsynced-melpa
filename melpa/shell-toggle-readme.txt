Description:

Provides the command shell-toggle which toggles between the
shell buffer and whatever buffer you are editing.

This is done in an "intelligent" way.  Features are:
o Starts a shell if none is existent.
o Minimum distortion of your window configuration.
o When done in the shell-buffer you are returned to the same window
  configuration you had before you toggled to the shell.
o If you desire, you automagically get a "cd" command in the shell to the
  directory where your current buffers file exists; just call
  shell-toggle-cd instead of shell-toggle.
o You can conveniently choose if you want to have the shell in another
  window or in the whole frame.  Just invoke shell-toggle again to get the
  shell in the whole frame.

This file has been tested under Emacs 20.2.
