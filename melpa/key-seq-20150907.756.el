;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides functions to map pairs of sequentially but
;; quickly pressed keys to commands:
;;
;;  - `key-seq-define-global' defines a pair in the global key-map,
;;  - `key-seq-define' defines a pair in a specific key-map.
;;
;; The package depends on key-chord.el and it requires active
;; key-chord-mode to work. Add this line to your configuration:
;;
;;    (key-chord-mode 1)
;;
;; The only difference between key-chord-* functions and key-seq-*
;; functions is that the latter executes commands only if the order of
;; pressed keys matches the order of defined bindings. For example,
;; with the following binding
;;
;;    (key-seq-define-global "qd" 'dired)
;;
;; dired shall be run if you press `q' and `d' only in that order
;; while if you define the binding with `key-chord-define-global' both
;; `qd' and `dq' shall run dired.
;;
;; To unset key sequence use either `key-seq-unset-global' or
;; `key-seq-unset-local'.
;;
;; For more information and various customizations see key-chord.el
;; documentation.
;;
;; The code in key-seq.el is 99% copy/paste from key-chord.el.
