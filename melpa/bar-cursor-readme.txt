 Simple package to convert the block cursor into a bar cursor.  In
 overwrite mode, the bar cursor changes back into a block cursor.
 This is a global minor mode.

Installation:

1. Place bar-cursor.el somewhere on your Emacs load path.
2. Add (require 'bar-cursor) to your .emacs
3. Add (bar-cursor-mode 1) to your .emacs

bar-cursor.el is also available in Melpa.  See
https://github.com/melpa/melpa#usage for information on using
Melpa.  Then you can run M-x package-install bar-cursor to install
it.
