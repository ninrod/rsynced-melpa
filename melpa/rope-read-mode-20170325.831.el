;;; Commentary:

;; =rope-read-mode= can reverse every other line of a buffer or in a part
;; of a buffer.  With every other line reversed reading can be like
;; following a rope.

;; Turning it on and off
;; ---------------------

;; =M-x rope-read-mode= in a buffer activates rope-read.  No visible
;; change in the buffer is to be expected.  The buffer is set read-only.

;; Type =M-x rope-read-mode= or press 'q' to quit rope-read.  The buffer
;; writability gets restored.

;; Action
;; ------

;; When =rope-read-mode= is on you can press
;; - =C-g= to interrupt =rope-read-mode= anytime
;; - =q= to quit =rope-read-mode=
;; - =?= to open the help buffer
;; - =r= /redraw standard/ to go back to the representation of the buffer
;;   without reversed lines (keeping =rope-read-mode=)
;; - =p= /paragraph/ to reverse every other line starting with the line
;;   below the cursor up to the end of the paragraph (if visible) and
;;   move point there
;; - The next four commands are each followed by reversing every other
;;   line in the visible part.  The keys are taken the same as in
;;   =view-mode=:
;;   - =SPC= to scroll a screen down
;;   - =<backspace>= or =S-SPC= to scroll a screen up
;;   - =v= or =<return>= to scroll one line down
;;   - =V= or =y= to scroll one line up
;; - =g= /get the rope-read/ to trigger reversing every other line for
;;   the currently visible part of the buffer
;; - =d= /downwards/ to reverse every other line starting with the line
;;   below the cursor

;; For convenience you can bind command =rope-read-mode= to a key.  For
;; example to activate or deactivate =rope-read-mode= by pressing scroll
;; lock two times use the line

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<Scroll_Lock> <Scroll_Lock>") 'rope-read-mode)
