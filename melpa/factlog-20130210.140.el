;;; Commentary:

;; You need Python program factlog [1] to use this package.
;; factlog can be installed easily by "pip install factlog".
;; If you are using factlog.el from Git repository, you don't
;; need to install factlog separately.

;; To use factlog.el, simply add the following in your configuration:
;;
;;   (require 'factlog)
;;   (factlog-mode)

;; You need helm.el or anything.el to access recently opened file list.
;;
;; * List recently opened files:
;;   `helm-factlog-list' / `anything-factlog-list'
;; * List recently opened notes and choose them by title:
;;   `helm-factlog-list-notes' / `anything-factlog-list-notes'
