;;; Commentary:

;; Variable-pitch support for org-mode.  This minor mode enables
;; ‘variable-pitch-mode’ in the current Org-mode buffer, and sets some
;; particular faces up so that they are are rendered in fixed-width
;; font.  Also, indentation, list bullets and checkboxes are displayed
;; in monospace, in order to keep the shape of the outline.

;;; Installation:

;; Have this file somewhere in the load path, then:

;;   (require 'org-variable-pitch)
;;   (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-variable-pitch-minor-mode)

;;; Configurables:

;;   - ‘org-variable-pitch-fixed-font’: The font used for parts of the
;;     buffer to be kept in fixed-width font.

;;   - ‘org-variable-pitch-fixed-faces’: List of org-mode faces to
;;     keep monospace.
