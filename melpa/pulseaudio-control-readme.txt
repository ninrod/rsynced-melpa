## Installation

Install [pulseaudio-control from MELPA](http://melpa.org/#/pulseaudio-control), or put `pulseaudio-control.el` in your load-path and do a `(require 'pulseaudio-control)'.

## Usage

Initially, the `pulseaudio-control' keymap is not bound to any prefix. You can call the command `pulseaudio-control-default-keybindings' to use the prefix `C-x /' to access the `pulseaudio-control' keymap globally; if you wish to use this prefix by default, add the line:

    (pulseaudio-control-default-keybindings)

to your init file.

The default keybindings in the `pulseaudio-control' keymap are:

* + : Increase the volume of the currently-selected sink by `pulseaudio-control-volume-step' (`pulseaudio-control-increase-volume').

* - : Decrease the volume of the currently-selected sink by `pulseaudio-control-volume-step' (`pulseaudio-control-decrease-volume').

* v : Directly specify the volume of the currently-selected sink (`pulseaudio-control-set-volume').  The value can be:

  * a percentage, e.g. '10%';
  * in decibels, e.g. '2dB';
  * a linear factor, e.g. '0.9' or '1.1'.

* m : Toggle muting of the currently-selected sink (`pulseaudio-control-toggle-current-sink-mute').

* x : Toggle muting of a sink, specified by index (`pulseaudio-control-toggle-sink-mute-by-index').

* e : Toggle muting of a sink, specified by name (`pulseaudio-control-toggle-sink-mute-by-name').

* i : Select a sink to be the current sink, specified by index (`pulseaudio-control-select-sink-by-index').

* n : Select a sink to be the current sink, specified by name (`pulseaudio-control-select-sink-by-name').

Customisation options, including `pulseaudio-control-volume-step', are available via the `pulseaudio-control' customize-group.
