This is a typing game for Emacs.  In this game, you type words that are
picked randomly from N most frequent words in language you're practicing,
until time is up (by default it's one minute).  It's mostly quite similar
to the “10 fast fingers” tests, with the difference that it's playable
and fully configurable inside your Emacs.
