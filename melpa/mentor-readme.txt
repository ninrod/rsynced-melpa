mentor is a GNU Emacs frontend for the `rTorrent' bittorrent client.

By default, it will start and run rTorrent from within Emacs but can also be
configured to use an external rTorrent instance over XML-RPC.

This project aims to provide a feature complete and highly customizable
interface, which will feel familiar to Emacs users.  Key bindings are chosen
to be as close to the vanilla rTorrent curses interface as possible.
