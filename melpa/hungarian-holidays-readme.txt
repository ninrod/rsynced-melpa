This package adds Hungarian (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary)
public holidays to the Emacs calendar.

If you have `org-agenda-include-diary` set to `t`, these will be
also listed in the `org-agenda` view.

Installation

This package is available on MELPA, just `M-x` `package-install`
`hungarian-holidays`. If you want to install it manually, clone
this repository somewhere, add it to `load-path`, and add
`(require 'hungarian-holidays)` to `.emacs`.

Configuration

Add a call to `(hungarian-holidays-add)` somewhere in your
`.emacs`.  Note that this must be called *before* Emacs calendar
is loaded.

Attribution

This package is based on David Chkhikvadzeâ€™s `czech-holidays'
package.
