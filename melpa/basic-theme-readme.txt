The theme attempts to reduce the usage of colors to a minimum based on my
personal preferences.  It's not fully monochrome, for example diffs and
active regions are distinguished via colors. The theme assumes no font-lock,
i.e. (global-font-lock-mode 0), so there is very little customization for
syntax aware faces. The used colors are from the base16 set that is available
at: https://github.com/chriskempson/base16 set.
