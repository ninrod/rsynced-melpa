;;; Commentary:

;; This is a major mode to support using lit:
;; <https://github.com/cdosborn/lit>. Could be very useful combined
;; with polymode. Markdown support is planned. I also plan to add
;; console integration support, so for example C-c C-c would run 'lit
;; -c <file>' and something else 'lit -m <file>'.

;;; Code:

(defgroup lit nil
  "Major mode for editing lit literate source files"
  :group 'languages
  :prefix "lit-")

;; lit grammar regexes
;; Actually a very simple grammar

(defconst lit-macro-delimiters-rx
  (rx (or "<<" ">>" ">>=")))

(defconst lit-macro-definition-rx
  (rx "<<" (1+ blank) (group-n 1 (minimal-match (1+ (not (any ?> ))))) (1+ blank) ">>=" eol))

(defconst lit-macro-reference-rx
  (rx "<<" (1+ blank) (group-n 1 (minimal-match (1+ (not (any ?> ))))) (1+ blank) ">>" eol))

;; The narrative is anything that isn't indented at all.
;; In other words, not part of a macro or macro reference.
(defconst lit-narrative-rx
  (rx bol (not (syntax whitespace)) (0+ not-newline)))

;; Font-lock data for syntax highlighting
(defconst lit-font-lock-defaults

     ))
  "Basic lit syntax.")

(defvar lit-mode-tab-width 8
  "Standard tab width for lit.
Set to nil to disable so you can use a custom width.")

;; Derives from text-mode to prevent string highlighting
(define-derived-mode lit-mode text-mode "lit"
  "Major mode for editing lit literate source files."
