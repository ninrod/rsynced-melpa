Open the `elgrep-menu' via menu item "Tools" -> "Search files (Elgrep)...".
There are menu items for the directory, the file name regexp for filtering
and the regexp for grepping.
Furthermore, you can also switch on recursive grep.

Run M-x elgrep to search a single directory for files with file
name matching a given regular expression for text matching a given
regular expression.
With prefix arg it searches the directory recursively.
