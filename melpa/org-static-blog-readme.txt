Static blog generators are a dime a dozen. This is one more, which
focuses on being simple. All files are simple org-mode files in a
directory. The only requirement is that every org file must have a
#+TITLE and a #+DATE, and optionally, #+FILETAGS.

This file is also available from marmalade and melpa-stable.

Set up your blog by customizing org-static-blog's parameters, then
call M-x org-static-blog-publish to render the whole blog or
M-x org-static-blog-publish-file filename.org to render only only
the file filename.org.

Above all, I tried to make org-static-blog as simple as possible.
There are no magic tricks, and all of the source code is meant to
be easy to read, understand and modify.

If you have questions, if you find bugs, or if you would like to
contribute something to org-static-blog, please open an issue or
pull request on Github.

Finally, I would like to remind you that I am developing this
project for free, and in my spare time. While I try to be as
accomodating as possible, I can not guarantee a timely response to
issues. Publishing Open Source Software on Github does not imply an
obligation to *fix your problem right now*. Please be civil.
