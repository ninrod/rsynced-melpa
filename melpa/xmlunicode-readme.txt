This file provides a suite of functions designed to make it easier
to enter Unicode into Emacs. It is not, in fact, particularly XML-specific though
it does define an 'xml input-mode and does support the ISO 8879 entity names.

Usage

1. By default, the entire Unicode character list (as defined in
   xmlunicode-character-list.el) will be loaded. You can tailor
   the selection of characters presented in the list by defining
   xmlunicode-character-list before loading xmlunicode. The
   xmlunicode-character-list is a list of triples of the form:

   (codepoint "unicode name" "iso name") ; iso name can be nil

   e.g.:   (defvar xmlunicode-character-list
            '(
              ;Codept   Unicode name                            ISO Name
              (#x000000 "NULL"                                   nil     )
              (#x000001 "START OF HEADING"                       nil     )
              ...
              (#x0000a0 "NO-BREAK SPACE"                         "nbsp"  )
              (#x0000a1 "INVERTED EXCLAMATION MARK"              "iexcl" )
              (#x0000a2 "CENT SIGN"                              "cent"  )
              ...))


2. Bind the functions defined in this file to keys you find convenient.

   The likely candidates are:

   xmlunicode-character-insert            insert a character by unicode name
                                          (with completion)
   xmlunicode-iso8879-character-insert    insert a character by ISO entity name
                                          (with completion)
   xmlunicode-smart-double-quote          inserts an appropriate double quote
   xmlunicode-smart-single-quote          inserts an appropriate single quote
   xmlunicode-character-menu-insert       choose special character from a popup menu
   xmlunicode-character-shortcut-insert   enter a two-character shortcut for a
                                          unicode character

   Helm integration is provided in `xmlunicode-helm.el`. For helm,
   use the function `xmlunicode-character-insert-helm`.

   You can also create a standard Emacs menu for the character menu list
   (instead of, or in addition to, the popup). To do that:

   (define-key APPROPRIATE-MAP [menu-bar unichar]
     (cons "UniChar" xmlunicode-character-menu-map))

   Where APPROPRIATE-MAP is the name of the Emacs keymap to bind into

3. If you want to use the xml input-mode, which provides automatic replacement for the
   ISO entity names:

   (set-input-method 'xml)

   in the appropriate context. Unlike sgml-input, xml-input only inserts the
   characters for which you have glyphs. It inserts other characters as numeric
   character references. (If you want to insert a literal character even if
   you don't have it in your fonts, use xmlunicode-character-insert or
   xmlunicode-iso8879-character-insert with a prefix.)

Changes

v1.21 24 Nov 2019
  Moved the helm-related functions into a separate file. Helm must be
  setup before you can require 'xmlunicode-helm. This avoids an ugly bug
  where (I infer) the byte compiled xmlunicode.el file did not have
  a correct function reference for `helm-build-sync-source` so it didn't
  work reliably.
  I made a few small improvements to `xmlunicode-show-character-list`.
v1.20 23 Nov 2019
  Fixed obvious typo in the name of the xmlunicode-iso8879-character-insert
  function name. (The xmlunicode prefix was repeated.)
v1.19
  Moved defun before defvar (WTF?). *blush*
v1.18
  Fixed bug where I failed to include the provide statement for the
  character list. *blush*
v1.17
  Updated the xmlunicode-character-list.el to Unicode 12.1.0 (from 3.1)
  Added helper scripts so that you can rebuild the list if you wish
  Removed xmlunicode-missing-list.el; whether or not characters are
  displayable is now computed dynamically
  (see xmlunicode-displayable-character).
v1.16
  Fixed the XML character input method so that it will leave
  &gt;, &lt; &amp; &quot; and &apos; alone.
v1.15
  Made the "smart" insert functions a little smarter; they only run
  the XML tests in an XML mode. Makes them easier and safer to use
  more globally.
  Added xmlunicode-default-single-quote so that you can change the
  default apostrophe (in places like contractions) to the rsquo.
v1.14
  Added codepoint to the helm character list
  Improved the xmlunicode-smart-hyphen function; just insert "-" if
  preceded by two "-"s.
v1.13
  Fix all symbol names to have 'xmlunicode-' namespace prefix.
  Added xmlunicode-character-insert-helm to use helm for character prompt
v1.12
  ???
v1.11
  Fix up some compile warnings and deprecations that modern Emacs
  reveals.  Also found a cut-n-paste bug in the ununsed
  unicode-to-codepoints.
v1.7
  Require "cl" because, well, because it's required. Also fiddled with
  the way single quotes are handled; the apostrophe is now part of the
  cycle
v1.6
  Remove debugging code. Embarrassed again. :-(
v1.5
  Fixed bug in unicode-smart-single-quote. It wasn't cycling through all
  three quotes correctly because of a typo in the function definition.
  Make sure smart semicolon insertion only happens if we're right at the
  end of a numeric character reference.
v1.4
  Fixed bug in insert-smart-semicolon. It wasn't careful to tie the search
  to the most recent preceding ampersand.
v1.3
  Fixed bug in (xmlunicode-in-comment)
  Added unicode-smart-semicolon as another convenience for entering Unicode chars
  Added show-unicode-character-list
v1.2
  Added unicode-smart-hyphen for easy insert of mdash and ndash
  Added unicode-smart-period for easy insert of hellip
  Fixed a bug in unicode-smart-single-quote
v1.1
  Fixed a few bugs with respect to how numeric character references are entered.
  Added xml-tag-search-limit and unicode-charref-format
v1.0
  First release. Nearly a complete rewrite from the former xmlchars.el file
