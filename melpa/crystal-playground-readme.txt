This is port of github.com/grafov/rust-playground for Crystal
language.  You can spin up a temporary project to play around with
some Crystal code.  It uses 'crystal new app', so the playground can
have external deps added in the shard.yml, and it has a git repo
initialized, so it isn't too hard to copy a playground into a
standalone app.
