;;; Commentary:

;; Compare version strings.

;; Similar functionality is available in Emacs; see `version<' and
;; friends defined in `subr.el'.  Unfortunately those functions have
;; some limitations.
;;
;; This library can parse more version strings and doesn't treat
;; certain versions as equal that are not actually equal.

;; What is a valid version string is defined jointly by the regular
;; expression stored in variable `vcomp--regexp' and the function
;; `vcomp--intern' and best explained with an example.
;;
;; Function `vcomp--intern' converts a string to the internal format
;; as follows:
;;
;;   0.11a_rc3-r1 => ((0 11) (97 103 3 1))
;;
;;   0.11         => (0 11)  valid separators are ._-
;;       a        => 97      either 0 or the ascii code of the lower
;;                           case letter (A is equal to a)
;;        _rc     => 103     100 alpha
;;                           101 beta
;;                           102 pre
;;                           103 rc
;;                           104 --
;;                           105 p
;;                           _ is optional, - is also valid
;;           3    => 3       if missing 0 is used
;;            -r1 => 1       there are no variations of -rN
;;
;; A less crazy version string would be converted like this:
;;
;;   1.0.3 => ((1 0 3) (0 104 0 0))
;;
;; The internal format is only intended for ... internal use but if
;; you are wondering why a flat list does not do:
;;
;;   1.97 => (1 97)
;;   1a   => (1 97)

;; There are other ways of dealing with this and similar problems.
;; E.g. the built-in functions treat 1 and 1.0 as equal and only
;; support pre-releases of sorts but not patches ("-pN") like this
;; library does.  Having an internal format that doesn't make any
;; compromises but has to be explained seems like the better option.
;;
;; Functions `vcomp-compare' and `vcomp--compare-interned' can be used
;; to compare two versions using any predicate that can compare
;; integers.
;;
;; When comparing two versions whose numeric parts have different
;; lengths `vcomp--compare-interned' fills in -1.
;;
;;   1.0    => ((1 0) ...)   => ((1 0 -1) ...)
;;   1.0.0  => ((1 0 0) ...) => ((1 0  0) ...)
;;
;; So 1.0.0 is greater than 1.0 and 1.0 is greater than 1.  If you
;; don't want that set `vcomp--fill-number' to 0.
;;
;; This filling has to happen in `vcomp--compare-interned' as we don't
;; know the length of the other versions when `vcomp--intern' is called.

;; Function `vcomp-normalize' can be used to normalize a version string.
;;
;;   0-11A-Alpha0-r1 => 0.11a_alpha-r1
;;   2.3d-BETA5      => 2.3d_beta5
;;
;; That's the way I like my version strings; if you would like this to
;; be customizable please let me know.
