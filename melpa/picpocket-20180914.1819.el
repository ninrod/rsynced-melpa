;;; Commentary:

;; Picpocket is an image viewer which requires GNU Emacs 24.4+
;; compiled with ImageMagick.  It have commands for:
;;
;; * File operations on the picture files (delete, move, copy, hardlink).
;; * Scale and rotate the picture.
;; * Associate pictures with tags which are saved to disk.
;; * Filter pictures according to tags.
;; * Customizing keystrokes for quick tagging and file operations.
;; * Undo and browse history of undoable commands.
;;
;;
;; Main entry point
;; ----------------
;;
;; Command: picpocket
;;
;; View the pictures in the current directory.
;;
;;
;; Main keybindings
;; ----------------
;;
;; Space     - Next picture
;; BackSpace - Previous picture
;; r         - Rename picture file
;; c         - Copy picture file
;; k         - Delete picture file
;; t         - Edit tags
;; s         - Slide-show mode
;; [         - Rotate counter-clockwise
;; ]         - Rotate clockwise
;; +         - Scale in
;; -         - Scale out
;; u         - Undo
;; M-u       - View history of undoable actions
;; e         - Customize keystrokes (see below)
;; TAB f     - Toggle full-screen
;; TAB r     - Toggle recursive inclusion of pictures in sub-directories
;;
;; With prefix argument many of the commands will operatate on all the
;; pictures in the current list instead of just the current picture.
;;
;;
;; Disclaimer
;; ----------
;;
;; Picpocket will secretly do stuff in the background with idle
;; timers.  This includes to load upcoming pictures into the image
;; cache.  The intention is that they should block Emacs for so short
;; periods that it is not noticable.  But if you want to get rid of
;; them set `picpocket-inhibit-timers' or kill the picpocket buffer.
;;
;; Picpocket is to be considered beta software.  Keybindings,
;; variables and such may change in future versions.  Tag database
;; file format will remain backwards compatible though.
;;
;;
;; Keystroke customization
;; -----------------------
;;
;; Keystokes can be bound to commands that move/copy pictures into
;; directories and/or tag them.  The following creates commands on
;; keys 1 though 5 to tag according to liking.  Also creates some
;; commands to move picture files to directories according to genre.
;; Finally creates also one command to copy pictures to a backup
;; directory in the user's home directory.
;;
;; (defvar my-picpocket-alist
;;   '((?1 tag "bad")
;;     (?2 tag "sigh")
;;     (?3 tag "good")
;;     (?4 tag "great")
;;     (?5 tag "awesome")
;;     (?F move "fantasy")
;;     (?S move "scifi")
;;     (?P move "steampunk")
;;     (?H move "horror")
;;     (?U move "urban-fantasy")
;;     (?B copy "~/backup")))
;;
;; (setq picpocket-keystroke-alist 'my-picpocket-alist)
;;
;; Digits and capital letters with no modifiers is reserved for these
;; kind of user keybindings.
;;
;; It is recommended to set `picpocket-keystroke-alist' to a symbol as
;; above.  That makes the command `picpocket-edit-keystrokes' (bound
;; to `e' in picpocket buffer) jump to your definition for quick
;; changes.  Edit the list and type M-C-x to save it.
;;
;; See the doc of `picpocket-keystroke-alist' for about the same thing
;; but with a few more details.

;;
;; Tag database
;; ------------
;;
;; Tags associated with pictures are saved to disk.  By default to
;; ~/.emacs.d/picpocket/.  This database maps the sha1 checksum of
;; picture files to list of tags.  This implies that you can rename or
;; move around the file anywhere and the tags will still be remembered
;; when you view it with picpocket again.
;;
;; If you change the picture file content the sha1 checksum will
;; change.  For example this would happen if you rotate or crop the
;; picture with an external program.  That will break the association
;; between sha1 checksum and tags.  However picpocket also stores the
;; file name for each entry of tags.  The command
;; `picpocket-db-update' will go through the database and offer to
;; recover such lost associations.
;;
;; If you change the file-name and the file content at the same time
;; there is no way to recover automatically.

;;; Database

;; This "database" stores a hash table in a text file.
;; The file format is:
;;
;; (version VERSION)
;; (format FORMAT)
;; (data-version DATA-VERSION)
;;
;; where VERSION is the integer version of the picp database and
;; DATA-VERSION is the integer version of the stored data.  FORMAT is
;; either list or hash-table.  In case of hash-table format the next
;; value is the hash table itself.  The hash table maps sha1 checksums
;; to data entries.  In case of list format lists like (SHA DATA)
;; follows for every hash table entry.
;;
;; TODO
;; SQL support (no, not really)
;; NoSQL support (don't we have that already?)
