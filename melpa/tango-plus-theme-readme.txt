Color theme for Emacs loosely based on the tango palette.  The
basis for this theme was the tango theme part of Emacs 24 but
recent versions deviate considerably.  Some colors where added to
increase contrast.  Also, support was added for evil, org mode,
mu4e, helm, epresent, and markdown-mode among others.
