* What is it?

  Emacs comes with a SQL interpreter which is able to open a connection
  to databases and present you with a prompt you are probably familiar
  with (e.g. `mysql>', `pgsql>', `sqlline>', etc.). This mode gives you
  the ability to do that for Sqlline.


* How do I get it?

  The canonical repository for the source code is
  [https://gitlab.com/matteo.redaelli/sql-sqlline] .

  The recommended way to install the package is to utilize Emacs's
  `package.el' along with MELPA. To set this up, please follow MELPA's
  [getting started guide], and then run `M-x package-install
  sql-sqlline'.

* How do I use it?

  Within Emacs, run `M-x sql-sqlline'. You will be prompted by in the
  minibuffer for a server. Enter the correct server and you should be
  greeted by a SQLi buffer with a `sqlline>' prompt.

  From there you can either type queries in this buffer, or open a
  `sql-mode' buffer and send chunks of SQL over to the SQLi buffer with
  the requisite key-chords.
