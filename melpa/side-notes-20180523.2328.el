;; Side Notes
;; ==========

;; Quickly display your quick side notes in quick side window.

;; Side notes live in a file in the current directory defined by custom option
;; `side-notes-file', which defaults to "notes.txt".

;; Installation
;; ------------

;; Add the following to you init file:

;; (define-key (current-global-map) (kbd "M-s n") #'side-notes-toggle-notes)

;;; Code:

(defgroup side-notes ()
  "Display a notes file."
  :group 'convenience)

(defcustom side-notes-hook
  nil
  "Hook run after showing notes buffer."
  :type 'hook
  :group 'side-notes)

(defcustom side-notes-file
  "notes.txt"
  "Name of the notes file to find.

This is always relative to `default-directory'. The idea is that
your project has its own directory and notes file, but if you
would like to use a file-specific notes file, specify a string
with `add-file-local-variable'."
  :type 'string
  :safe 'stringp
  :group 'side-notes)
(make-variable-buffer-local 'side-notes-file)

(defcustom side-notes-select-window
