;;; Todo:
;;;; Bugs:

;; - Create function that checks if the current buffer is a valid post.
;; - If post is a draft, and cobalt-serve was not run with "--drafts", then don't allow previewing.
;; - cobalt-preview-post should get the path according to the post buffer.
;; - If start-process returns an error don't let it set cobalt--serve-process
;; - Fix error with cobalt-build when cobalt--current-site is nil.

;;;; Features:
;; - Create a cobalt-rename-post function.
;; - Create a cobalt-delete-post function.
;; - Create a cobalt-open-post function.
