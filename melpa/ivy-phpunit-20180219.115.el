;;; Commentary:
;;
;; You should always be able to find the latest version here at <URL:https://github.com/12pt/ivy-phpunit.el/>
;; This project is inspired by helm-phpunit but also provides additional utility such as selecting classes to test,
;; and allowing for fast swapping between test classes with ivy-phpunit-list-test-classes.
;;
;; Require the package and then call either `ivy-phpunit-test-function', `ivy-phpunit-list-test-classes', or `ivy-phpunit-test-class'.
