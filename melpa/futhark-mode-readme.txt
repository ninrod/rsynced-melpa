Futhark is a small programming language designed to be compiled to
efficient GPU code.  This Emacs mode provides syntax highlighting
and conservative automatic indentation for Futhark source code.  A
simple flycheck definition is also included.

Files with the ".fut" extension are automatically handled by this mode.

For extensions: Define local keybindings in `futhark-mode-map'.  Add startup
functions to `futhark-mode-hook'.
