Futhark is a small programming language designed to be compiled to efficient
GPU code.  This Emacs mode provides syntax highlighting, conservative
automatic indentation, interpreter interaction, and an optional flycheck
definition.

Files with the ".fut" extension are automatically handled by this mode.

For extensions: Define local keybindings in `futhark-mode-map'.  Add startup
functions to `futhark-mode-hook'.
