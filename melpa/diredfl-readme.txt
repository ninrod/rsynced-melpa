This is adapted from the extra font lock rules provided by Drew
Adams' `dired+' package, but published via a modern means, and with
support for older Emacsen removed.

Enable in all dired buffers by calling or customising `diredfl-global-mode'.

Alternatively:

    (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'diredfl-mode)
