;;
;;     ;; buffer order is now restored
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; Buffer-utils.el is a collection of functions for buffer manipulation.
;;
;; This library exposes very little user-level interface; it is
;; generally useful only for programming in Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; To use buffer-utils, place the buffer-utils.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'buffer-utils)
;;
;; The following functions and macros are provided:
;;
;;     `buffer-utils-all-in-mode'
;;     `buffer-utils-all-matching'
;;     `buffer-utils-bury-and-forget'   ; can be called interactively
;;     `buffer-utils-first-matching'
;;     `buffer-utils-huge-p'
;;     `buffer-utils-in-mode'
;;     `buffer-utils-most-recent-file-associated'
;;     `buffer-utils-narrowed-p'
;;     `buffer-utils-save-order'
;;     `buffer-utils-set-order'
;;
;; of which `buffer-utils-save-order' is the most notable.
;;
;; `buffer-utils-save-order' is a macro, similar to `save-current-buffer',
;; which saves and restores the order of the buffer list.
