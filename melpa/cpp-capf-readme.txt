Emacs built-in `completion-at-point' completion mechanism doesn't
support C in any meaningful by default, which this package tries to
remedy, by using clang's completion mechanism. Hence this package
requires clang to be installed (as specified in `cpp-capf-clang'.

If a header file is not automatically found or in the default path,
extending `cpp-capf-include-paths' or `cpp-capf-extra-flags' might
help.

`cpp-capf' is based on/inspired by:
