Kaolin is a set of eye pleasing themes for GNU Emacs
With support a large number of modes and external packages.
Kaolin themes are based on the pallete that was originally
inspired by Sierra.vim with adding some extra colors.

Kaolin-theme package includes the following themes:

 * kaolin-dark - a dark jade variant inspired by Sierra.vim
 * kaolin-light - light variant of the original kaolin-dark
 * kaolin-eclipse - a dark purple variant

Coming soon:

 * kaolin-ocean - dark blue variant

                      The end of the path is the beginning.
