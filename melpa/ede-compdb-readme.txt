EDE-compdb is a library that enables the Emacs Development Environment (EDE),
to be used with a compilation database, as provided by build tools such as
CMake or Ninja.  This enables CEDET to be automatically configured for use to
support parsing, navigation, completion, and so on.  This is especially useful
for C and C++ projects which are otherwise quite tricky to configure for use
with CEDET and other libraries.
