;;; Commentary:

;; This package extracts information from Emacs Lisp libraries.  It
;; extends built-in `lisp-mnt', which is only suitable for libraries
;; that closely follow the header conventions.  Unfortunately there
;; are many libraries that do not - this library tries to cope with
;; that.

;; It also defines some new extractors not available in `lisp-mnt',
;; and some generalizations of extractors available in the latter.

;;; Code:

(require 'lisp-mnt)

*** A value is returned in the hope that it will be useful, but
*** WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
*** MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

This function completely ignores and \"LICENSE\" or similar file
in the proximity of FILE.  The returned value is solely based on
the contents of FILE itself.

The license is determined from the permission statement, if any.
Otherwise the value of the \"License\" header keyword is
considered.  An effort is made to normalize the returned value.

*** However this function does not always return the correct
*** value and the returned value is not legal advice.

Note in particular that if this function returns nil, then that
merely merely means that it is not known what license applies.
This may be because the library lacks a permission statement
altogether (possibly because an accompanying \"LICENSE\" file
is considered sufficient by the upstream), but it may also be
because this function does not attempt to detect the used
non-standard and/or non-fsf permission statement, or because
of typos in the statement, or for a number of other reasons."
