dired-rmjunk is a port of Jakub Klinkovsk√Ω's home directory cleanup tool to
Dired. The interactive function, `dired-rmjunk' will mark all files in the
current Dired buffer that match one of the patterns specified in
`dired-rmjunk-patterns'. The tool is intended as a simple means for
keeping one's home directory tidy -- removing "junk" dotfiles.
