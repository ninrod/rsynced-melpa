Store uniform EIEIO objects in an EmacSQL database.  SQLite is used
as backend.  This library imposes some restrictions on what kind of
objects can be stored; it isn't intended to store arbitrary objects.
All objects have to share a common superclass and subclasses cannot
add any additional instance slots.

This is an alpha release.  Everything might change.  You probably
shouldn't use this in your own packages yet.  I am releasing this
now anyway because it is needed by Epkg, for which it was written.
Documentation will be written once the API has been stabilized.
