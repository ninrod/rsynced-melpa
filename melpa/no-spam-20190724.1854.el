;;; Commentary:
;;
;; `no-spam-mode' allows adding repeat delays to commands.
;; To add a repeat delay, use the macro `no-spam-add-repeat-delay',
;; then turn on `no-spam-mode' to enable the delays.

COMMAND may be a single command or a list of commands.  In the latter
case, the commands are all treated as one command and share the same
repeat delay.

EXCEPT is a zero-argument function that returns non-nil if COMMAND's
repeat delay should be bypassed.  EXCEPT defaults to
`no-spam-default-exception-fn'."
