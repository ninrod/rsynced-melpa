;;; Code:
(defun smart-backspace (n &optional killflag)
  "This function provides intellij like backspace.
Delete the backword-char usually and delete whitespace
to previous line indentation if it's start of line.
If a prefix argument is giben, delete the following N characters.

Optianal second arg KILLFLAG non-nil means to kill (save in killring)
instead of delete. Interactively, N is the prefix arg, and KILLFLAG
is set if N was explicitly specified."
  (interactive "p\nP")
  (let* ((current (point))
         (beginning (save-excursion
                      (beginning-of-line)
