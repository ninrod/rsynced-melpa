;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides an interface for dealing with the
;; [Mutant](https://github.com/mbj/mutant) testing tool, enabling
;; one to easily launch it from a `.rb` file or even from a `dired` buffer.
;; The generated output is nicely formatted and provides direct links
;; to the errors reported by the mutations. I've tried
;; to mimic the `rspec-mode` overall experience as much as possible.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; This package can be installed via `MELPA`, or manually by downloading
;; `mutant.el` and adding it to your init file, as it follows:
;;
;; ```elisp
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mutant")
;; (require 'mutant)
;; ```
;;
;; For having `mutant-mode` enabled automatically, I suggest you
;; to do the following:
;;
;; ```elisp
;; (add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'mutant-mode)
;; ```

;;; Usage:
;;
;; By default, the following keybindings will be available:
;;
;; * <kbd>C-c . f</kbd> runs `mutant-check-file`
;; * <kbd>C-c . c</kbd> runs `mutant-check-custom`
;;
;; For `dired` mode integration, just add the following to your
;; configuration file:
;;
;; ```elisp
;; (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'mutant-dired-mode)
;; ```
;;
;; By doing so, you'll be able to mark files and then press <kbd>C-c . f</kbd>
;; for running `mutant` on them.
;;
;; See the [Function Documentation](#function-documentation) for more details.

;;; Customization:
;;
;; If you're a `rvm` user, you might have to add the following to your
;; configuration file:
;;
;; ```elisp
;; (add-hook 'mutant-precompile-hook
;;           (lambda () (rvm-activate-corresponding-ruby)))
;; ```
;; Notice that this obviously requires `rvm.el` to be installed.
;;
;; In order to execute the `mutant` command with a `bundle exec` prefix,
;; simply add the following to your configuration file:
;;
;; ```elisp
;; (setq mutant-cmd-base "bundle exec mutant")
;; ```

;; 1.0 - First release. <br/>
