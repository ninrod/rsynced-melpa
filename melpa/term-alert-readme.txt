Notifications when commands complete in term.el.

Usage

Suppose you start a command in the terminal emulator, but it's
taking much longer than expected.  You want to go and do other
things, but don't want to have to keep checking the terminal buffer
to see if that command has finished.  So you use term-alert:

1. In the terminal buffer, run `term-alert-next-command-toggle'.
2. When the running command finishes, a notification pops up to
   tell you.

If you want to get notifications for all commands in a buffer (not
just the current/next one), run `term-alert-all-toggle', and all
commands will generate alerts until you explicitly turn it off.

Because it's entirely inside Emacs, you don't need to stop the
command to enable an alert on it (an advantage over 'alert' shell
commands, which usually require you to pause the command and
restart it).  And because it uses term-cmd
(https://github.com/CallumCameron/term-cmd), you can alert commands
running in tmux or over SSH, too (as long as the remote shell is
set up correctly).

Set up keybindings:

    ;; I'm on a UK keyboard, where # and ' are next to Enter
    (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-#") 'term-alert-next-command-toggle)
    (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "M-#") 'term-alert-all-toggle)
    (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-'") 'term-alert-runtime)

You can change what happens when an alert occurs by setting the
variable `term-alert-function'.


Installation

Install the term-alert package from MELPA.

Set up your shell; in zsh you also get timing information in
notifications.

- zsh: 'source ~/.emacs.d/term-alert/setup.zsh'
- bash: 'source ~/.emacs.d/term-alert/setup.bash'

(Replace ~/.emacs.d with wherever your `user-emacs-directory' is.)
