;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This program supports underlining with a certain character.
;;
;; When point is in an empty line then fill the line with a character
;; making it as long as the line above.
;;
;; This program provides just command `underline-with-char' and
;; variable `underline-with-char-fill-char'.

;; You can change the default underline character via
;;
;; M-x customize-variable underline-with-char-fill-char
