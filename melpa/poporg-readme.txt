poporg is a small Emacs Lisp project to help editing program strings and
comments using Org mode (or any other major mode).  This can be useful as it
is often more convenient to edit large pieces of text, like Emacs Lisp or
Python docstrings, in an org-mode buffer instead of in a comment or a string.

See the README.org file located at https://github.com/QBobWatson/poporg for
detailed usage information.
