;;; why not use shell-command-queue?
;;;   @ https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/shell-command-queue.el

;; * I didn't want to manage process names.
;; * I didn't want to kick `run' after `add'.
;;   * unless on errornous situation, developer just want the queue
;;     to be processed as soon as he publish the command
;; * license information was not clear.

;;; How to use

;; M-x command-queue-publish-command
;;  and enter the shell command you want to execute.
