;;; Commentary:

;; Provides a function `bibslurp-query-ads', which reads a search
;; string from the minibuffer, sends the query to NASA ADS
;; (http://adswww.harvard.edu/), and displays the results in a new
;; buffer called "ADS Search Results".

;; The "ADS Search Results" buffer opens in `bibslurp-mode', which
;; provides a few handy functions.  Typing the number preceding an
;; abstract and hitting RET calls `bibslurp-slurp-bibtex', which
;; fetches the bibtex entry corresponding to the abstract and saves it
;; to the kill ring.  Typing 'a' instead pulls up the abstract page.
;; At anytime, you can hit 'q' to quit bibslurp-mode and restore the
;; previous window configuration.

;;; Example usage:

;; add an entry to a bibtex buffer:
;;   M-x bibslurp-query-ads RET ^Quataert 2008 RET
;; Move to the abstract you want to cite with n and p keys, or search
;; in the buffer with s or r, and then press
;;   RET
;;   q
;;   C-y

;; If you want to select a different abstract, just type the
;; corresponding number before pressing RET:
;;   15 RET
;;   q
;;   C-y

;; For more examples and information see the project page at
;; http://astro.berkeley.edu/~mkmcc/software/bibslurp.html

;;; Advanced search
;; You can turn to the ADS advanced search interface, akin to
;; http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html, either by pressing
;; C-c C-c after having issued `bibslurp-query-ads', or directly with
;;   M-x `bibslurp-query-ads-advanced-search' RET
;; Here you can fill the wanted search fields (authors, publication
;; date, objects, title, abstract) and specify combination logics, and
;; then send the query either with C-c C-c or by pressing the button
;; "Send Query".  Use TAB to move through fields, and q outside an
;; input field to quit the search interface.

;;; Other features
;; In the ADS search result buffer you can also visit some useful
;; pages related to each entry:
;;  - on-line data at other data centers, with d
;;  - on-line version of the selected article, with e
;;  - on-line articles in PDF or Postscript, with f
;;  - lists of objects for the selected abstract in the NED database,
;;    with N
;;  - lists of objects for the selected abstract in the SIMBAD
;;    database, with S
;;  - on-line pre-print version of the article in the arXiv database,
;;    with x
;; For each of these commands, BibSlurp will use by default the
;; abstract point is currenly on, but you can specify a different
;; abstract by prefixing the command with a number.  For example,
;;   7 x
;; will fire up your browser to the arXiv version of the seventh
;; abstract in the list.

;;; Notes about the implementation:

;; 1. As far as I know, ADS doesn't have an API for searching its
;;   database, and emacs doesn't have functionality to parse html.
;;   Since I don't want to implement a browser in emacs lisp, that
;;   leaves me parsing the html pages with regexps.  While that would
;;   be a terrible idea under ordinary circumstances, the ADS pages
;;   are all automatically generated, so they should conform to a
;;   pretty regular format.  That gives me some hope...

;; 2. There are many ways you can customize the behaviour of biblurp.
;;    I define font-lock faces at the beginning of the file so you can
;;    add these to your color theme.  I also run a mode hook at the
;;    end of `bibslurp-mode', so you can inject your own code at that
;;    point.

;;; Installation:

;; Use package.el. You'll need to add MELPA to your archives:

;; (require 'package)
;; (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;              '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)

;; Alternatively, you can just save this file and do the standard
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/bibslurp.el")
;; (require 'bibslurp)

;;; TODO:
;;  1. add hooks for show-abstract?
;;  2. finish documentation
;;  3. clean up code
;;  4. rethink regexps
