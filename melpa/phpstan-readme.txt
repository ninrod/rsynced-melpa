with `M-x flycheck-select-checker'.

## Directory local variables

Put the following into .dir-locals.el files on the root directory of project.
Each variable can read what is documented by `M-x describe-variables'.

    ((nil . ((php-project-root . git)
             (phpstan-executable . docker)
             (phpstan-working-dir . (root . "path/to/dir"))
             (phpstan-config-file . (root . "path/to/dir/phpstan-docker.neon"))
             (phpstan-level . 7))))
