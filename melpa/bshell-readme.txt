This package allows an Emacs user to create, delete, rename and fast swtich
between multiple inferior shells using the buffer-manager library.  This is
done by extending the `buffer-manage` and using its functions and
keybindings to manage multiple inferior shells.  To summarize, this
includes:
* A major mode for switching to, deleting and starting new shells.
* Fast switching with customized key bindings through the customize
  framework.
* Track and rename shells by name through the shell entry management mode.
* Interact with buffer shell (entries) as objects with a straight forward
  API.
