;;; Commentary:

;; xah-reformat-code contains commands to reformat current paragraph into 1 long line or multiple short lines.

;; It is like emacs `fill-region', but designed for programing language source code.

;; it contain commands to strictly exchange whitespaces by newline, or vice versa. No adding other char or removing other char.

;; this is suitable for languages that strictly consider whitespaces equivalent except in string or comment. For example, XML, HTML, CSS, lisp, Wolfram Language.

;; 2016-12-16 todo:
;; • auto skip strings and comments.
;; • cut lines at the proper logical locations, not just around 70 char.
;; • do proper indentation when changing to multi-line.
;; • cater to different languages. e.g. lisp, JavaScript, ruby, php, Java, etc.
;; • add commands to work on buffer, file, or all files in a directory.

;; --------------------------------------------------
;; MANUAL INSTALL

;; put the file xah-reformat-code.el in ~/.emacs.d/lisp/
;; create the dir if doesn't exist.

;; put the following in your emacs init file:

;; (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
;; (require 'xah-reformat-code)

;; --------------------------------------------------
;; HOW TO USE

;; M-x xah-reformat-lines

;; don't use this in Python code!

;; • Whitespace here is defined to be space, tab, and newline character.
;; • Repeated whitespace is considered equivalent to just 1 space or just 1 newline char.
;; • Whitespace is never created if it didn't exist before.
;; • Whitespace is never removed.
;; • No character other than whitespace are removed or inserted.

;; in the future, this package will expand to complete reformat. That is, given a singe very loooooooong line of code, it will reformat it into multiple lines in a pretty way, with proper place to insert newline, proper indentation, and skipping comment line or string.


;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(defun xah-reformat-lines ()
  "Reformat current text block into 1 long line or multiple short lines.
When there is a text selection, act on the selection, else, act on a text block separated by blank lines.

When the command is called for the first time, it checks the current line's length to decide to go into 1 line or multiple lines. If current line is short, it'll reformat to 1 long lines. And vice versa.

Repeated call toggles between formatting to 1 long line and multiple lines.
