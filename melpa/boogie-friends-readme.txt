* (Experimental) Navigation between Dafny and Boogie source files
* (Some support for) indentation
* (Some support for) jumping to a definition
* (Experimental) Support for using Dafny as a verification server

See https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie-friends/ for a full description.
The documentation that accompanies certain snippets in dafny-mode was not
written as part of this package; it is automatically generated from Dafny's
quick reference guide.
