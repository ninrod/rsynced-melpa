;;; Commentary:

;; This switches Emacs buffers according to
;; most-recently-used/least-recently-used order using `C-tab` and
;; `C-S-tab` keys. It is similar to window or tab switchers that are
;; available in PC desktop environments or applications.

;;; ChangeLog:

;; 2015-09-18 (3.0 release)
;; Support for the customization.
;; Support for autoloading.
;; Using pc-bufsw- for public and pc-bufsw-- for private functions and
;; variables, not non-standard pc-bufsw:: prefix for function names.

;; 2007-06-27 (2.0 release)
;; Removal of window switching facility making pc-bufsw to switch only between
;; buffers. Emacs and window managers provides enough key bindings to switch
;; between windows and frames.

;; 2005-08-25
;; Introduction of pc-bufsw--keep-focus-window mode. This is not the
;; start of the feature creep as the old mode is kept for compatibility
;; as users may not appreciate the new behavior.

;; 2005-08-17 (1.3 release)
;; * Use buffer-display-time to construct buffer list in proper least
;;   recently used order to defeat bury-buffer abuse by various tools.
;; * When switching from initial window, restore the original buffer
;;   there.
;; * Fix frame switching using select-frame-set-input-focus. It does
;;   not resolve all the issue, but at least it works.

;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(defun pc-bufsw-mru ()
  "Switch to the most recently used buffer."
  (interactive)
  (pc-bufsw--walk 1))

;;;###autoload
(defun pc-bufsw-lru ()
  "Switch to the least recently used buffer."
  (interactive)
  (pc-bufsw--walk -1))

;;;###autoload
