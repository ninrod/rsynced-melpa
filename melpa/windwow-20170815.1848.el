;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a small collection of functions for saving and
;; loading window and buffer configurations.  A buffer configuration is
;; a list of buffers and a window configuration is an arrangement of windows
;; in a frame.  Right now window configurations created only with split
;; and switch commands are supported.  These functions can be called interactively
;; (via `M-x`) or from keybindings.

;; ## Functions
;; ### Buffer
;;  - `windwow-save-buffer-list` - saves current buffers and prompts for name
;;  - `windwow-load-buffer-list` - loads a previously saved buffer list
;;  - `windwow-load-buffer-from-list` - loads a buffer from a saved buffer list
;;
;; ### Window
;;  - `windwow-save-window-configuration` - saves current window configuration
;;  - `windwow-load-window-configuration` - loads a previously saved window configuration
;;
;; ### Buffer and window
;;  - `windwow-load-window-configuration-and-buffer-list` - loads a window configuration and a buffer list
