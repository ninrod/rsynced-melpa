This is an implemenatation of the Shen programming language in
Elisp. The end goal is to provide:

1. An easy way to play with Shen with no other installation
   hassle (assuming you use Emacs).
2. A first-class development experience when writing Shen.
   The idea is that an editor that understands the code can
   be much more helpful than one that does not. To this end
   the roadmap involves a full gamut of source code
   introspection and debugging tools.
