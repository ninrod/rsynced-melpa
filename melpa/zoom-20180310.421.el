;;; Commentary:

;; This minor mode takes care of managing the window sizes by enforcing a fixed
;; and automatic balanced layout where the currently selected window is resized
;; according to `zoom-size' which can be an absolute value in lines/columns, a
;; ratio between the selected window and frame size or even a custom callback.

;;; Code:

(defgroup zoom nil
  "Enforce a fixed and automatic balanced window layout."
  :group 'windows)

(defcustom zoom-size '(80 . 24)
  "Size hint for the selected window.

It can be either a cons or a function.

Each component of the cons can be either an absolute value in
lines/columns or a ratio between the selected window and the
frame size.  In the former case the window is resized according
to its body size, i.e., the total window size can be much larger.
In any case, windows are never shrinked if they are already
larger than the resulting size.

The function takes no arguments and returns a cons as specified
above."
