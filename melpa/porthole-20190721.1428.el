;;; Commentary:

;; Porthole lets you start RPC servers in Emacs. These servers allow Elisp to be
;; invoked remotely via HTTP requests.

;; You can expose data that exists within Emacs, or control Emacs from an
;; external program. You can also execute Elisp functions on data (such as text)
;; that exists outside Emacs.

;; ---

;; Porthole servers are designed to "just work." All your server needs is a name
;; and clients will be able to find it automatically. Here's a typical workflow:

;; In Emacs:

;;   1. Pick a name and start your server.
;;   2. Tell it which functions you want to be available to RPC calls.

;;   Now, continue using Emacs.

;; In the Client:

;;   1. Load the connection information from your server's session file (this
;;      file has a known path).
;;   2. POST a JSON-RPC request to the server.

;;   *Emacs executes your RPC call and returns the result.*

;;   3. Parse the JSON-RPC 2.0 object you received.

;; There's even a Python Client to handle the client-side automatically.

;; See README.md for more information and usage examples.

  "Start a new Porthole server with advanced configuration.

JSON-RPC requests to the server should be sent in the body of
POST requests. They should be sent according to the JSON-RPC 2.0
specification, although the server will also tolerate JSON-RPC
1.x requests. JSON-RPC protocols >2.0 are not supported.

The server optionally supports Basic Access Authentication to
authenticate RPC requests:

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication

If you would like to use Basic Access Authentication, specify the
keyword arguments `:USERNAME' or `:PASSWORD'. You do not need to
provide both (although it is obviously recommended). For example,
if you provide only a password, the empty string will be used for
the username.

By default, session information is written to a known file so
local clients can connect automatically. This file is only
accessible to the current user. See the README for a full
explanation of how to configure clients. This behavior is
configurable - see the arguments for more.

Arguments:

`NAME-OF-SERVER' - This is the name Porthole uses to identify your
  server. It should be simple, memorable and unique. Server
  creation will fail if a server with the same name is already
  running. This argument is mandatory.

`:PORT' - the port the server will run on. Use a value of 0 to
  have the server start on a dynamic port. Default: 0

`:USERNAME' - The username to use for Basic Authentication. If
  this and the password are unspecified, no authentication will
  be used. Default: nil

`:PASSWORD' - The password to use for Basic Authentication. If
  this and the username are unspecified, no authentication will
  be used. Default: nil

`:PUBLISH-PORT' - Whether to publish the port to the server's
  session file. Default: t

`:PUBLISH-USERNAME' - Whether to publish the username to the
  server's session file. Default: t

`:PUBLISH-PASSWORD' - Whether to publish the password to the
  server's session file. Default: t

`:EXPOSED-FUNCTIONS' - A list of functions to expose immediately
  upon server creation. See `porthole-expose-function' for more.
