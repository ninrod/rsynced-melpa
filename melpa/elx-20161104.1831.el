;;; Commentary:

;; This package extracts information from Emacs Lisp libraries.  It
;; extends built-in `lisp-mnt', which is only suitable for libraries
;; that closely follow the header conventions.  Unfortunately there
;; are many libraries that do not - this library tries to cope with
;; that.

;; It also defines some new extractors not available in `lisp-mnt',
;; and some generalizations of extractors available in the latter.

;;; Code:

(require 'lisp-mnt)
