This package emulates a Rubik's Cube in Emacs.  The cube is shown
in 2 projections; this way all its sides are visible.  The cube can
be manipulated by commands similar to rotational language notation,
and they can be prefixed with 2 or i to denote double or inverse
rotation, respectively.

Undo and redo queues are maintained.
