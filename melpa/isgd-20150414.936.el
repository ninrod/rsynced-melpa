;; Simple mode to shorten URLs from Emacs.

;; Adapted from bitly.el from Jorgen Schaefer <forcer@forcix.cx>
;; available here https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/bitly-el

;; Use (isgd-shorten URL) from an Emacs Lisp program, or
;; M-x isgd-url-at-point to replace the URL at point (or the region)
;; with a shortened version.

;;; Code:
(require 'thingatpt)
(require 'url-util)

;; User variables
(defvar isgd-base-url "http://is.gd/api.php")

;; Functions
(defun isgd-shorten (long-url)
  (let ((buf (url-retrieve-synchronously
              (format "%s?longurl=%s"
                      isgd-base-url (url-hexify-string long-url)))))
    (with-current-buffer buf
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (search-forward "\n\n" nil t)
      (let ((beg (point)))
        (end-of-line)
        (filter-buffer-substring beg (point))))))

(defun isgd-at-point ()
  "Replace the URL at point with a shortened one.

    (if (not bounds)
        (error "No URL at point")
