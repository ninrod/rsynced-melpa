;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Signal is a library offering enriched hook-like features.
;; With signal, you are able to handle condition-based function
;; calls with arguments.
;; You can also make delayed condition-based function calls.
;;
;; You can see full introduction on

Connect a signal to a worker function by `signal-connect'.

Example:
\(defsignal my-signal

  "Connect a SIGNAL to its WORKER function.
Use `signal-emit' to emit a SIGNAL.

After a signal is emitted, the WORKER function is
called with arguments ARG.

If mutiple connections have been made, the WORKER functions
are called in order or making connection.

Example:
\(signal-connect :signal 'my-signal

\(signal-disconnect :signal 'my-signal

DELAY is the second the worker functions delayed to run after
the signal has been emitted. It can be a floating point number
which specifies a fractional number of seconds to wait.
By default, it is 0 second.

ARG provides emit-time argument passing to the worker funcitons.

Example:
\(signal-emit 'my-signal)"
