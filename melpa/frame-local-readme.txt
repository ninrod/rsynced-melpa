Access variables local to a frame

You can use the functions frame-local-[set,get,setq,getq]
With frame-local-[setq,getq], the variables don't need to be quoted

It is recommended to prefix the variables with your package name
to not create conflicts with variables from other packages.

Examples:
(frame-local-set 'my-variable 1)
(frame-local-get 'my-variable)
(frame-local-setq my-other-variable 2 some-frame)
(frame-local-getq my-other-variable some-frame)

Note that the variables created with this package don't have any
relation with variables defined by `defvar', `defconst' etc.
