Radiobuttons are groups of options where exactly one option has to
be selected at all times.

Org mode checkbox lists allow selecting from a list of candidates
but the user would have to manually ensure the radiobutton
property.

This package provides a convenient minor mode that will make sure
the property is satisfied for lists which are marked as radiobutton
lists.
