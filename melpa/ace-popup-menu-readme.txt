This package allows to replace the GUI popup menu (created by
`x-popup-menu' by default) with a little temporary window (like that in
which Dired shows you files you want to copy).  In this window, menu
items are displayed and labeled with one or two letters.  You press a key
corresponding to desired choice (or C-g if you wish to cancel the
operation) and you are done.
