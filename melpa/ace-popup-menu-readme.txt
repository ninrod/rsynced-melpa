This package allows to replace GUI popup menu (created by `x-popup-menu'
by default) with little temporary window (like that in which Dired shows
you files you want to copy).  In this window, menu items are displayed
and labeled with one or two letters.  You press a key corresponding to
desired choice (or C-g) and you are done.
