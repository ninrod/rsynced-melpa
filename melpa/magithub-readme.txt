Magithub is an interface to GitHub using the `hub' utility [1].

Integrated into Magit workflows, Magithub allows very easy, very
basic GitHub repository management.  Supported actions include:

 - pushing brand-new local repositories up to GitHub
 - creating forks of existing repositories
 - submitting pull requests upstream
 - viewing and creating issues

Press `H' in the status buffer to get started -- happy hacking!
