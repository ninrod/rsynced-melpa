`helm-fuzzy-find.el' is a Helm extension for the `fuzzy-find' command
line program (https://github.com/silentbicycle/ff), you can use it to
search files under a directory using Fuzzy Search.

When you want to search files only according to their base-names, use the
notable `find' program and its helm interface `helm-find' instead, but if
you also use their parent directory names, i.e., full absolute path name of
a file or directory, `fuzzy-find' is probably better.  You can read
`fuzzy-find''s homepage and manual page to learn more about these.


Installation
============

To install, make sure this file is saved in a directory in your `load-path',
and add the line:

  (require 'helm-fuzzy-find)

to your Emacs initialization file.


Usage
=====

M-x helm-fuzzy-find to launch `helm-fuzzy-find' from the current buffer's
directory, if with prefix argument, you can choose a directory to search.

Like `helm-find', you can also launch `helm-fuzzy-find' from
`helm-find-files' (it usually binds to `C-x C-f' for helm users) by typing
`C-c C-/' (you can customize this key by setting `helm-fuzzy-find-keybind').

Note
====

To use `helm-fuzzy-find', you need to know the format (**NOT** regexp) of the
query string of `fuzzy-find', especially the meaning of "/" character and "="
character, refer to its manual page for more info.

To install `fuzzy-find' on Mac OS X via MacPorts:

  $ sudo port install fuzzy-find
