;;; Commentary:
;; This file defines a major mode for editing Dedukti files.
;; Dedukti is a type checker for the lambda-Pi-calculus modulo.
;; It is a free software under the CeCILL-B license.
;; Dedukti is available at the following URL:
;; <https://www.rocq.inria.fr/deducteam/Dedukti/>

;; This major mode is defined using the generic major mode mechanism.
