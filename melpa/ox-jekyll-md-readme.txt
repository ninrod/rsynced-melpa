This library implements a Jekyll-style md backend for
Org exporter, based on `md' back-end.

It provides two commands for export, depending on the desired
output: `org-jekyll-md-export-as-md' (temporary buffer) and
`org-jekyll-md-export-to-md' ("md" file with YAML front matter).

For publishing, `org-jekyll-md-publish-to-md' is available.
For composing, `org-jekyll-md-insert-export-options-template' is available.
