Quickstart

    (require 'browse-url-dwim)

    (browse-url-dwim-mode 1)

    place the cursor on a URL
    press "C-c b"

    select some text
    press "C-c g"

    ;; to turn off confirmations
    (setq browse-url-dwim-always-confirm-extraction nil)

Explanation

This small library for calling external browsers combines some of
the functionality of `browse-url' and `thingatpt'.

Three interactive commands are provided:

    `browse-url-dwim'
    `browse-url-dwim-search'
    `browse-url-dwim-guess'

each of which tries to extract URLs or meaningful terms from
context in the current buffer, and prompts for input when unable
to do so.

The context-sensitive matching of `browse-url-dwim' tries to do
_less_ overall than the default behavior of `thingatpt', on the
theory that `thingatpt' matches too liberally.  However,
`browse-url-dwim' does recognize some URLs that the default
`browse-url' ignores, such as "www.yahoo.com" without the
leading "http://".

To use `browse-url-dwim', add the following to your ~/.emacs file

    (require 'browse-url-dwim)      ; load library
    (browse-url-dwim-mode 1)        ; install aliases and keybindings

Then place the cursor on a URL and press

    C-c b                           ; b for browse

or select some text and press

    C-c g                           ; g for Google

or (equivalently)

    M-x browse RET
    M-x google RET

Outside the USA

If you are outside the USA, you will want to customize
`browse-url-dwim-permitted-tlds' so that your favorite
top-level domains will be recognized in context.  You
may also wish to customize `browse-url-dwim-search-url'
to point at an appropriate search engine.

    M-x customize-group RET browse-url-dwim RET
    M-x customize-group RET browse-url RET

Notes

To control which browser is invoked, see the underlying library
`browse-url'.

By default, the minor mode binds and aliases `browse-url-dwim-guess'
for Internet search, but the user might prefer to bind
`browse-url-dwim-search', which has less DWIM:

    (define-key browse-url-dwim-map (kbd "C-c g") 'browse-url-dwim-search)

Bugs

    `thing-at-point-short-url-regexp' requires at least two dots in the hostname,
    so "domain.com" cannot be detected at point, whereas the following will be:
    "www.domain.com" or "http://domain.com"

    `url-normalize-url' doesn't do much.  Multiple slashes should be removed
    for a start.

TODO

    Support thing-nearest-point, with fallback.

    Test various schemes, esp "file:", "mailto:", and "ssh:".

    Extract multiple URLs from region and browse to all.
