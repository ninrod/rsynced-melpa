sendto is a little tool that make me convenience to call some functions with region content

Quick start:

1. specify ~sendto-function-list~

The value should be a list of functions which accept a string.or a region(point and mark as 2 numeric args, smallest first)

2. turn on sendto-mode: ~M-x sendto-mode~

3. mark a region, and then click mouse-3, It will popup a menu

4. select the function you want
