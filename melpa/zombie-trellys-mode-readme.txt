This is a minor mode for interaction with Zombie - a
dependently-typed language that is a result of the Trellys
project. Due to limited time, zombie-trellys-mode is implemented as
a minor mode with a command for loading the current buffer's file
into Zombie and viewing the results. This mode inherits
`haskell-mode' to get a somewhat reasonable highlighting
experience.

Zombie is available from https://code.google.com/p/trellys/
