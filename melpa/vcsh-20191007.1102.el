;; Package-Version: 20191007.1102
;; Keywords: vc, files
;; License: public domain
;; Version: 0.4.2
;; Tested-with: GNU Emacs 27
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "25"))

;;; Commentary:

;; Original idea by Jonas Bernoulli (see the first two links below).

;; This library only provides basic "enter" functionality
;; (`vcsh-link', `vcsh-unlink') and a few convenience commands
;; (`vcsh-new' to init a repo and add files to it,
;; `vcsh-write-gitignore').

;; For Magit integration there's magit-vcsh.el as a separate add-on
;; library.

;; Please note that this library works by creating a regular file
;; named ".git" inside $VCSH_BASE directory (typically $HOME) and does
;; not remove this file automatically, so don't be surprised if your
;; shell suddenly behaves as after "vcsh enter" when inside that
;; directory.  You can use `vcsh-unlink' or simply remove the file to
;; get rid of it.

;; Cf. also:

;; Corrections and constructive feedback appreciated.
