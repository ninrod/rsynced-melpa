;;; Commentary:

;; Load this package
;;
;; (require 'cycle-resize)
;;
;; You can then call these two methods, once you have at least 2 windows:
;;
;; M-x cycle-resize-window-vertically
;; M-x cycle-resize-window-horizontally
;;
;; and eventually bind some keys like:
;;
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-v") 'cycle-resize-window-vertically)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-h") 'cycle-resize-window-horizontally)
;;
;; You also can configure the dimensions (in %) the package will cycle through
;; By default, it is: 80% -> 50% -> 20% -> 50%, and so on...
