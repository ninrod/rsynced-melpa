voca-builder is an Emacs package that aimed to help you build up your
vocabulary by automating the most step in the process, so that you
actually spent time in learning new words.
It will do the checking, and shows the meaning as a popup above the
text. It also records the meaning and the sentence containing the word.
Finally, it can export vocabularies that have the same tags, or are
between two dates.
