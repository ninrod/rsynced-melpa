\\[quit-window]    Remove the Buffer Menu from the display.
\\[tabulated-list-sort]    sorts buffers according to the current
     column. With a numerical argument, sort by that column.
\\[Buffer-menu-this-window]  Select current line's buffer in place of the buffer menu.
\\[Buffer-menu-other-window]    Select that buffer in another window,
     so the Buffer Menu remains visible in its window.
\\[Buffer-menu-switch-other-window]  Make another window display that buffer.
\\[Buffer-menu-mark]    Mark current line's buffer to be displayed.
\\[Buffer-menu-select]    Select current line's buffer.
     Also show buffers marked with m, in other windows.
\\[Buffer-menu-1-window]    Select that buffer in full-frame window.
\\[Buffer-menu-2-window]    Select that buffer in one window, together with the
     buffer selected before this one in another window.
\\[Buffer-menu-isearch-buffers]    Incremental search in the marked buffers.
\\[Buffer-menu-isearch-buffers-regexp]  Isearch for regexp in the marked buffers.
\\[Buffer-menu-multi-occur] Show lines matching regexp in the marked buffers.
\\[Buffer-menu-delete]  Mark that buffer to be deleted, and move down.
\\[Buffer-menu-delete-backwards]  Mark that buffer to be deleted, and move up.
\\[Buffer-menu-execute]    Delete or save marked buffers.
\\[Buffer-menu-unmark]    Remove all marks from current line.
     With prefix argument, also move up one line.
\\[Buffer-menu-backup-unmark]  Back up a line and remove marks.
\\[revert-buffer]    Update the list of buffers.

;; 	rcirc-menu.el: explain what T and P are

;; 2017-08-12  Alex Schroeder  <alex@gnu.org>
;; 
;; 	rcirc-menu.el: guess target when rcirc-target is nil

;; 
;; 	rcirc-menu.el: catchup marked buffers
;; 
;; 	When catching up, check for marked buffers. If there are any, catch up

;; 	buffer.
;; 
;; 2017-08-11  Alex Schroeder  <alex@gnu.org>
;; 
;; 	rcirc-menu.el: make rcirc-menu-update more resilient
;; 
;; 	If the buffer doesn't exist, don't create it. If it exists but it 
;; 	doesn't have use a mode derived from tabulated-list-mode, ignore it. If
;; 	we don't do that, updating the rcirc activity string will call 
;; 	tabulated-list-revert which might throw an error.
;; 
;; 2017-08-10  Alex Schroeder  <alex@gnu.org>
;; 
;; 	rcirc-menu.el: add catching up and updating

;; 	string will also update the menu buffer.
