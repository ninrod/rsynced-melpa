;;; Commentary:

;; This Brief editor emulator was originally based on the CRiSP mode
;; emulator (listed below), with extensive rewriting.
;;
;;  CRiSP mode from XEmacs: revision 1.34 at 1998/08/11 21:18:53.
;;
;;   CRiSP mode was created on 01 Mar 1996 by
;;   "Gary D. Foster <gfoster@suzieq.ml.org>"

;; There is also an Emacs version of "crisp.el" which is now obsolete
;; but still (temporarily) exists in the Emacs source code repository
;; at "<emacs>/src/lisp/obsolete/crisp.el".  In case of it being
;; removed from Emacs source tree someday, I moved the whole
;; development history from Emacs source into ELPA repository at
;; "<elpa>/packages/crisp".  To check the whole development history
;; log you need to clone the ELPA git repository, then go to
;; sub-directory "packages/crisp" and type the command
;; "git log --follow crisp.el".  Notice the "--follow" argument,
;; lacking it git will only give you the history "after" the
;; directory structure changed, which was introduced when moving
;; CRiSP from Emacs source repository to ELPA.

;;; History:

;; Starting from 31 May 2001 I started modifying XEmacs CRiSP mode
;; emulator for my own use on Linux, in order to get a similar
;; finger-feel like the MS-DOS-based Brief editor which I had been
;; using for ~10 years at that time.  Those days around 2001 the
;; MS-DOS backward compatibility was getting worse and worse for
;; every MS-Windows release and which forced me to find a free
;; replacement for Brief.  Then I found the XEmacs+CRiSP mode that
;; seems to be the best candidate at that moment.  It implemented at
;; least the basic Brief editor functionality but far from a complete
;; emulator.  Therefore I started doing modifications and adding
;; missing Brief features on a per-need basis.
;;
;; After 17+ years of intermittent development (as the release of
;; version 5.80), the code is almost completely rewritten compare to
;; the original XEmacs CRiSP mode code.
;;
;; A lot of editor behaviors were also adapted to Emacs.  One example
;; is that Brief mode emulator could respect `visual-line-mode',
;; `toggle-truncate-lines' and hidden/abbreviated mode texts (which
;; usually shown as "..." in Emacs) such as org-mode, hideshow mode
;; and hideif (hide "#ifdef", conditional compilation units, another
;; package that I had rewritten).  When texts are hidden at cursor
;; line, Brief line-oriented commands like line-cut, line-copy,
;; line-deletion ... will operate on all hidden lines.
;;

;;; Brief Extension:

;;
;; This Brief mode extends a lot of functionalities that the original
;; Brief editor don't have.  For example, the original Brief <ctrl>-<->
;; (C--) kills current buffer; however, when prefixed with <ctrl>-<u>
;; (C-u) the <ctrl>-<-> (C--) command will restore the just killed
;; buffer.  This is convenient as sometimes user accidentally hit C--
;; for some reason and lost the buffer.  Another simple example is the
;; original Brief command <alt>-<f> (M-f) which shows the file name of
;; the current buffer; while prefixed with C-u it will also copy the
;; file name into the clipboard.  The following sections list some of
;; the major extensions of this extended Brief mode.
;;
;; * Visual mode, line truncation and hidden texts:
;;   (config option: `brief-linecmd-respect-visual')
;;
;; In the original DOS Brief editor, press [home] key once brings the
;; cursor to the beginning of the current line; a second [home] key to
;; the top of the window and the third [home] to the beginning of the
;; file.  In Emacs it's a bit different; it has `toggle-truncate-lines'
;; to wrap long lines and `visual-line-mode' to do smart word-warp.
;; This Brief mode emulator thus adapted to Emacs accordingly: if long
;; lines are wrapped, the first [home] keystroke brings the cursor to
;; the beginning of the "visual line"; a second [home] then brings the
;; cursor to the beginning of the "physical line".  The third [home] to
;; the top of the window and finally the fourth [home] to the beginning
;; of the file.  When `toggle-truncate-lines' is enabled and
;; `visual-line-mode' is off, Brief mode then behaves the same as DOS
;; Brief.  Similar behavior applies to the [end] key, as well as many
;; other keyboard commands like clipboard copy/paste functions.
;;
;; This further leads to an user-customizable option:
;; `brief-linecmd-respect-visual'.  This customized variable determines
;; if a user would like to have line commands (like line-copy, line-cut,
;; line-deletion...) by default respect visual mode or not.  That
;; variable is by default nil and thus line commands will by default
;; operate on "physical" line(s) instead of "visual" lines.  They
;; can be overridden by a common prefix C-u or a negative prefix
;; number.
;;
;; See the comments of the function `brief-is-visual-operation' for
;; more detail.
;;
;;  Basically, the rules are:
;;
;;   1. `brief-linecmd-respect-visual' determines the current default
;;      mode, either visual or physical line mode.
;;   2. Either a common prefix C-u (\\[universal-argument]) or negative
;;      prefix reverse the current mode; aka,
;;      (not `brief-linecmd-respect-visual').
;;
;;  Example:
;;
;; Try editing a text using line deletion command [M-d] on some very
;; long lines a few times longer than the window width (or shrink
;; window size), or an org-mode document with long lines. Now either
;; turn on `visual-line-mode' or enable line wrapping using
;; `toggle-truncate-lines'.  Assuming `brief-linecmd-respect-visual'
;; is kept default value 'nil' which means physical line operations
;; are expected by default, now try the following key combinations:
;;
;;   1. [M-d]               : delete one "physical" line.
;;   2. [C-u] [M-d]         : delete one "visual" line.
;;   3. [C-4] [M-d]         : delete four "physical" lines as it's
;;                            prefixed with integer '4'.
;;   4. [C-u] [-] [4] [M-d] : delete four "visual" lines as it's
;;                            prefixed with integer '-4'.
;;
;; On the other hand, cursor movement always respects visual mode
;; unless prefixed with C-u or negative prefix number.
;;
;; * Fast line number computation cache:
;;   (config option: `brief-replace-emacs-func:line-number-at-pos')
;;
;; Brief editor window operation relies heavily on cursor position to
;; determine which window is going to be operated.  As the original
;; Emacs line number computation is too slow (especially when a lot
;; of texts are hidden within a window) so a line counting caching
;; mechanism is implemented.  By default, the original Emacs function
;; `line-number-at-pos' is replaced by `brief-fast-line-number-at-pos'
;; if Emacs version is older than 27 where native line numbering is
;; not yet supported.  There is actually a custom variable named
;; `brief-replace-emacs-func:line-number-at-pos' defined near the end
;; of this file.  It controls if the `line-number-at-pos' is going
;; to be replaced or not, regardless of the Brief mode is on or off.
;;
;; It is recommended to keep the default value for fast line number
;; calculation which helps Linum mode as well, otherwise, you might
;; experience big slow down when switching windows using Brief window
;; commands (i.e. [F1] [<arrow>] keys).
;;
;; * Huge clipboard/Xselection texts:
;;   (config option: `brief-enable-postpone-selection')
;;
;; In the following context and code the term Xselection and clipboard
;; are used interchangeably and refer to the same thing - the XWindow
;; selection (mainly "primary" and "clipboard", "secondary" is not
;; used) or the Windows clipboard.  This emulator tries to sync kill-
;; ring with Xselection even in terminal mode (Xterm).
;;
;; This Brief mode also implements an asynchronous mechanism to
;; prevent the selected texts from immediately going into the
;; Xselection, as all (most) *NIX GUI program currently do -- any
;; marked/selected text got copied into Xselection with no delay.
;;
;; This helps to boost performance a lot especially when huge texts
;; (say, 500Mb texts) are being selected.  There is no point to keep
;; copying texts into clipboard before user completed the text
;; selection.  When the user tries to enlarge the huge selection area,
;; copying texts into clipboard could take very long and the system
;; seems to stop responding.  The auto-repeated cursor movement key
;; commands are then accumulated into the key queue and make things
;; worse.  Our Brief mode does not immediately copy texts into
;; Xselection until the cursor movement key is released, which usually
;; means a user has completed (say, at least temporarily) the
;; selection.  Unfortunately, this key-releasing event cannot be seen
;; within Emacs Lisp so we workaround this by detecting if the keyboard
;; is idle or not. Functions are called asynchronously by the idle
;; timer.
;;
;; There is also another important reason for doing so, on Xservers
;; running on MS Windows with MS office running in the background,
;; this problem is fatal and usually caused a system crash in the end.
;; With this selection postponement, we prevented that.  For more
;; detail description about the MS problem, please search the comments
;; in the following source code containing "Xselection Postponement:".
;; The solution is not perfect but works for most cases.
;;
;; A custom option `brief-enable-postpone-selection' is defined to
;; control if the selection postponement is enabled or not.  By
;; default, it's turned on.
;;
;; * External Xselection helper programs `xsel' and `xclip':
;;   (config option: `brief-use-external-clipboard-when-possible')
;;
;; In order to further boost the performance when a user selects huge
;; texts, external Xselection helper programs are used, although it
;; increased the complexity of the asynchronous event handling.  The
;; main reason is that the internal Emacs Xselection code is
;; un-interruptible and not quit-able.  When Emacs tries to get/set
;; Xselection, the operation is blocking and Emacs is not responding
;; to any key before the operation completes.
;;
;; For example, when a user selects some huge texts using arrow keys
;; and paused a short period of time then try to continue enlarging/
;; shrinking the selection area using arrow keys, the previous Emacs
;; Xselection get/set operation is usually not completed yet (due to
;; the size of huge text).  Therefore the attempt to continue
;; enlarging/shrinking texts will be blocked and user will experience
;; no response until Emacs completed the Xselection operation.  What's
;; more, those continued arrow keys then in turn queued in the Xwindow
;; system.  When Emacs eventually resume responding, the selection
;; area will be changed accordingly to some earlier keys in the queue
;; that the user typed a few seconds ago.  This kind of non-real-time
;; response usually confuse the user and sometimes cause problems.
;;
;; To workaround this we implemented our own non-blocking and quit-able
;; Xselection get/set functions, with the help of external X utilities
;; like `xsel' or `xclip'.  Therefore user needs to install `xsel' or
;; `xclip' in the *NIX system to get the benefit.  If neither xsel nor
;; xclip is installed, it will fall back using the Emacs internal
;; blocking Xselection code.  With our non-blocking implementation,
;; when a user tries to enlarge/shrink/quit a huge text selection
;; while the Xselection gets/sets operation is in-progress, the
;; unfinished operation will be interrupted immediately.  A user gets
;; an immediate response.
;;
;; A custom variable `brief-use-external-clipboard-when-possible' (by
;; default 't) controls if this Brief mode would invoke external helper
;; or not.  For further detail consult the help message for function
;; `brief-external-set-selection' and `brief-external-get-selection'.
;; There are also a few other configuration options controlling if
;; the progress is showing in the message area or not:
;;    `brief-show-external-clipboard-recv-progress'
;;    `brief-show-external-clipboard-send-progress' ...
;; With these two options, the user can see the progress when big
;; clipboard data are transferring.
;;
;; Also, notice that for terminal mode Emacs under X running Brief mode
;; the external helpers are always invoked in order to copy/paste texts
;; with any other windowed mode applications.
;;
;; * Fast cursor movement:
;;
;; What I like most about the old DOS Brief editor is its super fast
;; cursor movement.  On a lot of occasions, I didn't even need to do
;; page-up or page-down.  Once you get used to the cursor speed you
;; really don't want to return to the normal speed.  Unfortunately,
;; this cannot be done in Emacs.  However, there is an alternative way
;; to achieve similar effect -- setting X keyboard autorepeat rate
;; using the command line `xset' X utility:
;;
;;  # xset r rate 255 100
;;
;; Although it's still not as fast as DOS Brief editor, it's at least
;; closer.  Also, notice that this will affect the global X window
;; environment.
;;

;;; Key Binding Compatibility Note:

;; Notice that the original brief commands keypad-'+' (copy line) and
;; keypad-'-' (cut line) are now duplicated into <control>-<insert>
;; (copy line) and <shift>-<delete> (cut line).  This is mainly for
;; keyboards and notebooks without a keypad.
;;
;; As both <Alt>-<n> (M-n) and <Alt>-<p> (M-p) are so widely used in
;; various Emacs modes so in the Brief mode M-n and M-p are assigned
;; "weakly". This means any major mode can override the assignment of
;; M-n and M-p.  In Brief mode, M-n is used for switching to next
;; buffer while M-- for the previous buffer.  Both of them are
;; frequently used commands, therefore, we also weakly assigned M-+
;; and M-= for M-n and M-_ for M--.  However, for M-p (brief-print)
;; we do not provide other key combinations for the same key.
;;
;; For line marking commands, as Emacs regions always start/end at
;; cursor so the Brief mode region commands <Alt>-<L> <arrow> (M-L
;; prefixed arrow keys) behave a bit differently from the original
;; Brief ones (unless I implemented it using the secondary Xselection,
;; which could lead to more issues).  This Brief mode does not
;; immediately mark the current line until the followed arrow key user
;; typed.  Also, the 'paste' command key <insert> also insert keys
;; starting from the cursor position instead of the beginning of
;; current line.  On the other hand, 'copy line', 'cut line' and
;; 'delete line' commands work on the beginning of current line like
;; the original Brief editor did.
;;
;; For a complete keybinding list, check the following source code
;; commented with "Brief mode key bindings".

;;; Platform Compatibility Notes:

;; This brief mode is mainly tested for X window system, as there are
;; too many combinations of versions (EmacsVers x {OSes} x {XServers})
;; need to be tested but I don't have all environments (and time).
;; Therefore, I mainly tested recent Emacs versions on Linux machines
;; on a daily use basis.  For other combinations listed below they
;; are not heavily tested; usually tested when they are been used.
;;
;; Test Matrix (note: all 64-bit systems):
;;
;; On Linux: (including native X11 Emacs, terminal mode Emacs on xterm
;;            and Linux X11 Emacs running on VcXsrv (1.19.3.4+) under
;;            Win10):
;;      Emacs 23.3.1, 24.4.50.2, 25.2.2, 26.0.50, 26.1 and 27.0.50.
;;      Mainly focusing on Emacs 25 ~ 27.
;;      For Emacs23 and 24, not all the functionality behaves the same
;;        as in Emacs 25 ~ 27 (ex. search/replace in region/rectangle).
;; On Cygwin:
;;      Emacs 25.3.1, 26.1.
;; On Win10:
;;      Emacs 25.1.1 (x86_64-w64-mingw32).
;; On WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):
;;      Emacs 24.5.1, terminal mode and on VcXsrv (1.19.3.4+).
;;

;;; Enabling Brief Mode:

;; Enable this package by putting "(require 'brief)" in your .emacs
;; and "(brief-mode 1)" to enable it.  If you want to toggle it later
;; interactively just use "M-x brief-mode" to toggle it on or off.
;; Notice that "M-x" may be overridden if `brief-override-meta-x' is
;; set to non-nil (default value) when you enable brief mode.  In this
;; case use function key #10 "F10 brief-mode" to toggle it off.

;; The default keybindings for Brief mode override the M-x key to exit
;; the editor.  If you don't like this functionality, you can prevent
;; this behavior (or redefine it dynamically) by customizing the value
;; of `brief-override-meta-x' either in your .emacs or interactively.
;; The default setting is t, which means that M-x will by default
;; by default run `save-buffers-kill-emacs' instead of the command
;; `execute-extended-command'.

;; It is recommended to load the Ibuffer package "(require 'ibuffer)"
;; before or after loading Brief mode.  "M-b" will invoke ibuffer
;; to show buffer menu if ibuffer package presents, otherwise it by
;; default runs `buffer-menu'.

;; This package will automatically load the "scroll-lock.el" package if
;; you put "(setq brief-load-scroll-lock t)" in your .emacs before
;; loading this package.  If this feature is enabled, it will bind
;; "<Scroll_Lock>" to the scroll-lock mode toggle.  The scroll-lock
;; package provides the scroll-locking feature in Brief.

;; Finally, if you want to change the string displayed in the modeline
;; when this mode is in effect, override the definition of
;; `brief-mode-mode-line-string' in your .emacs.  The default value is
;; " Brief" which may be a bit lengthy if you have a lot of things
;; being displayed there.

;; All these overrides should go *before* the (require 'brief)
;; statement.

;;; Cygwin 2.x Users:

;; When the default "mintty" application is used to lunch Cygwin, if
;; you would like to run Emacs with Brief mode enabled in mintty's
;; special terminal mode, some mintty window settings need to be
;; changed:
;;
;; 1. Right-click in the Cygwin "mintty" window on the title bar
;; 2. Choose "Options"
;; 3. At the left sided pane choose "Keys" category
;; 4. Disable (uncheck) the following shortcuts:
;;
;;      Copy and Paste (Ctrl/Shift+Ins)
;;      Switch window (Ctrl+[Shift+]Tab)
;;      Zoom (Ctrl+plus/minus/zero)
;;      Alt+Fn shortcuts
;;      Ctrl+Shift+letter shortcuts
;;
;; 5. Click 'Apply' and 'Save'

;;; Xselection Postponement:

;; Postpone changing Xselection till keyboard is idle for a while.
;;
;; This prevents message flooding on some X server systems that runs an
;; application broadcasting messages whenever clipboard changes.

;; A sample environment is a remote Linux machine running X11 Emacs displayed on
;; Xservers (VcXsrv, CygwinX, ... etc) running under Windows 10, with any of
;; Microsoft Office running (eg. MS Outlook, which usually sit in the background
;; for emails).
;;
;; With MS office application running, any change of the clipboard will cause
;; MS office application to broadcast 'WM_MSO_BROADCASTCHANGE' messages.  If
;; there are, say, 25 Xwindows on screen (for example, remote Emacs showing
;; 25 frames as VcXsrv/CygwinX windows), this broadcasted message will flood
;; into VcXsrv/CygwinX server message loop and cause problems.  Here are the
;; details I find it the hard way, after a long investigateion (notice that
;; Xserver here refers to Xservers running on MsWindows, say VcXsrv):
;;
;;   1. Usually a Emacs keyboard command is executed right after Xserver
;;      received the 'WM_KEYDOWN' message(s) of that command.  This happens
;;      *BEFORE* the 'WM_KEYUP' message(s) of that keyboard command.
;;   2. If that Emacs keyboard command changes the clipboard, this will
;;      immediately make MS office application fire 'WM_MSO_BROADCASTCHANGE'
;;      message broadcasted into all existing Windows, including all windows
;;      opened by Xserver.
;;   3. Now these messages goes into Xserver's message loop, it usually take
;;      a while to digest this message, this period sometimes exceed the
;;      keyboard auto-repeat time period and therefore that Emacs keyboard
;;      command start to repeat again and again.
;;   4. These auto-repeated keyboard commands changes the clipboard again
;;      and again and cause a lot more broadcasted messages and flood into the
;;      message loop of Xserver, causing infinite loop.
;;   5. The 'WM_KEYUP' message of that keyboard command thus never got a chance
;;      to be processed and thus this keyboard command repeats forever.
;;
;; An example of this is the region marking commands.  In Brief mode we press
;; [M-l] and '[up]/[down]'s to enlarge/shrink the marked region.  A common
;; behavior of *NIX terminals and editors are that they copy the selection
;; texts into clipboard in realtime as the selected texts area changes.  Emacs
;; region marking also do the same.  Thus marking region initiates the above
;; message flood.  The last up/down key will take effect and repeats forever.
;; Each time the up/down key command ran it resized the region, changed the
;; clipboard and make the flood grew bigger.  Eventually 'WM_KEYUP' message of
;; that up/down key is postponed forever.  What we can see on the screen is the
;; marked region grows bigger and bigger till the beginning/end of the edited
;; file is reached.
;;
;; Since Emacs and Xserver are now not responding, the only ways to stop it
;; are:
;;  1. Wait till the beginning/end of file is reached.  However this could take
;;     very long depend on the file size.
;;  2. Terminate Emacs by force, by login into this Linux machine with another
;;     machine and terminate it.
;;  3. Close all MS office applications.
;;
;; Sometimes if we waited too long the message flood will grow so big that all
;; CPUs runs in 100% and the host Windows system hangs (message queues of
;; Xserver and all windows will grow and eat up system memory fast).  To make
;; system respond again we need to unplug the network cable for a while (if
;; Emacs is running on a remote machine) or even reboot the host Windows machine.

;; To workaround this problem, we need to detect the KEY-UP message.  If system
;; do commands only *after* key-up, we won't have this problem as the key won't
;; be automatically repeated before all the messages in the message queue got
;; digested.  Unfortunately there is no way to detect KEY-UP message in eLisp.
;; Therefore, we need to emulate the key-up using idle timer.  When idle timer
;; expires it means all keys are already up for a while.  The workaround provided
;; here is that we postponed the copy of data into Xselection till a certain
;; period of keyboard idle-time.

;; However, without the exact detection of the KEY-UP, this problem is still
;; potentially happening if the Xserver host machine is either too slow or too
;; heavily loaded, while our idle time setting may still not be not long enough.
;; For those systems we also provides another mean to workaround this: turn on
;; the custom option `brief-debounce-keys-microsoft-office'.  It will debounce
;; the key commands if they are happening too fast: `brief-copy-line',
;; `brief-kill-line' and `brief-delete-entire-line'.



;; [2017-01-13 16:39:37 +0800]
;; Add mark-activation/deactivation hooks to prevent keep modifying Xselection
;; on marking region.  Whatever make clipboard change will cause Microsoft
;; office to broadcast WM_MSO_BROADCASTCHANGE to *ALL* openned windows which
;; could flood X server if a lot of X windows are currently openned.  This even
;; cause VcXsrv to drop important message like WM_KEYDOWN/WM_KEYUP and cause the
;; region marking operation goes forever, until network disconnect or all MS
;; Office applications closed.
;; (this issue take me almost a week to track down, using Visual Studio Spy++).

This function is non-blocking if external helper program is available,
unlike the default Emacs behavior that is usually blocking and not
interruptible.  If data is huge this blocking behavior could take very
long and the whole system respond time would be reduced a lot.

For Cygwin launching an external program is expensive so we use the
cygwin specific \"/dev/clipboard\" if user set the custom variable
`brief-cygwin-use-clipboard-dev' to be non-NIL.

When external helper program is launched, this non-blocking function
can be interrupted in two ways:

When marking a region, it's in \"interruptible\" mode; any keystroke
will interrupt current in-progress clipboard copying.  When performing
a `brief-copy-line' (\\[brief-copy-line]) it's in \"quittable\" mode where we
can only use `keyboard-quit' (\\[keyboard-quit]) command to interrupt it.

This function has an internal mode: `brief-is-external-interruptible'
which defines how this function can be interrupted.  If this variable
is not set this function is by default blocking and it will return
only when data are completely sent to the helper program.

This function does not support native Win32/Win64."

  ;; Notice that this function is a replacement for `gui-set-selection' which
  ;; has no mode.  Therefore the actual mode relies on the global flag
  ;; `brief-is-external-interruptible' which is controlled by function
  ;; `brief-run-postponed-gui-set-selection', which again calls

This function implements the following truth table, according to
current command prefix and the value of `brief-linecmd-respect-visual'.
The basic logic are:
 1. `brief-linecmd-respect-visual' determines the current default mode,
    either visual or physical line mode.
 2. Either a common prefix \\[universal-argument] or negative prefix
    reverse the current mode; aka, ~`brief-linecmd-respect-visual'.

         Prefix  |  brief-linecmd- || result:
         command |  respect-visual || visual?
        ---------+-----------------||--------

  ;; mode from local modes.
  ;; [2017-06-13 11:34:47 +0800] The above mentioned problem is because of the
  ;; :keymap.  When we defined a keymap with `brief-mode-map', `define-minor-mode'
  ;; will associate this minor mode (no matter it's named `global-brief-mode' or
  ;; `brief-mode') to that keymap in the `minor-mode-alist'.  When the mode variable
  ;; is ON, the keymap in the active `minor-mode-alist' is searched when translating
  ;; a key.  This will make those keys in `special-mode' failed (`ibuffer-mode',
  ;; `help-mode', and `info-mode', minibuffer... ). As `special-mode' is also a
  ;; minor mode but not presented in the `minor-mode-alist' so our keymap take
  ;; precedence and fail `special-mode' keys.
  ;;:variable global-brief-mode
  ;;:global t

  ;; Define my global `brief-mode' variable and a setter function to prevent
  ;; `define-minor-mode' define a buffer-local `brief-mode' associated with
  ;; this minor-mode.
