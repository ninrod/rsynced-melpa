;;; Commentary:

;; This is an inverse companion to the rx package for translating
;; regexps in string form to the rx notation.  Its chief uses are:
;;
;; - Migrating existing code to rx form, for better readability and
;;   maintainability
;; - Understanding complex regexp strings
;;   
;; Please refer to `rx' for more information about the notation.
;;
;; The exported functions are `xr', which simply returns the converted
;; rx expression, and `xr-pp', which pretty-prints the rx expression.
;; Suggested use is from an interactive elisp buffer.
;;
;; Example (regexp found in compile.el):
;;
;;   (xr-pp "\\`\\(?:[^^]\\|\\^\\(?: \\*\\|\\[\\)\\)")
;; =>
;;   (seq bos
;;        (or
;;         (not (any "^"))
;;         (seq "^"
;;              (or " *" "["))))
;;
;; The rx notation admits many synonyms; the xr functions mostly
;; prefer brief variants, such as `seq' to `sequence' and `nonl' to
;; `not-newline'.  The user is encouraged to edit the result for
;; maximum readability, consistency and personal preference when
;; replacing existing regexps in elisp code.

;; Similar functionality is provided by the `lex' package in the form of the
;; `lex-parse-re' function, but `xr' does not depend on `lex' and does
;; a more thorough job of handling all corner cases of Elisp's regexp syntax.
