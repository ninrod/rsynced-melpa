This library implements the JSONRPC 2.0 specification as described
in http://www.jsonrpc.org/.  As the name suggests, JSONRPC is a
generic Remote Procedure Call protocol designed around JSON
objects.  To learn how to write JSONRPC programs with this library,
see Info node `(elisp)JSONRPC'."

This library was originally extracted from eglot.el, an Emacs LSP
client, which you should see for an example usage.
