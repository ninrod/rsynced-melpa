;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Provides a large more easily readable grid for file browsing using
;; `ivy'. When `avy' is installed, commands for fast avy navigation
;; are available to the user, as well. Heavily inspired by
;; LustyExplorer:
;;
;; https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LustyExplorer
;;
;; Known Bugs:
;;
;; When the number of candidates don't fit into the ivy-explorer
;; window, moving down along the grid can change the order of elements
;; when new candidates get displayed. This can change the column the
;; user is currently in while moving vertically down or up. Although
;; this is a bit confusing the correct candidate gets selected.
;; Patches welcome!
