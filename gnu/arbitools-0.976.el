;; REQUIRES:
;; ---------------------------
;; Some functions require the arbitools python package, written by myself
;; you can install it by: "pip3 install arbitools"
;;
;; "pdflatex" by Han The Thanh is necessary in case you want to get pdfs.
;;            It is distributed under a GPL license.
;;            https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/
;;
;; "bbpPairings.exe" by Bierema Boyz Programming is necessary to do the
;;                   pairings. Copy the file to an executable folder,
;;                   for example /usr/bin.
;;                   Find bbpPairings in
;;                   https://github.com/BieremaBoyzProgramming/bbpPairings
;;                   under GPL license.
;;
;; USAGE:
;; ---------------------------
;; arbitools.el is an interface for the python package "arbitools",
;; designed to manage chess tournament reports.  If you don't install the
;; python package you can still have the syntax colouring and some native
;; functions. In the future, all the functions will be translated to ELISP.
;;
;; FEATURES:
;; ----------------------------
;; - Syntax colouring for the official trf FIDE files.  This facilitates
;; manual edition of the files.
;;
;; - Updating the players ratings. - with python
;;
;; - Adding players to an existing file. - with python
;;
;; - Getting standings from a tournament file. -with python
;;
;; - Getting IT3 Tournament report form. - with python
;;
;; - Deleting a round. - Native
;;
;; - Insert result. - Native
;;
;; - Insert player. - Native
;;
;; - Insert bye. - Native
;;
;; - Get the pairing list or results of a round - Native
;;
;; - Get the list of the players - Native
;;
;; - Delete player. Adjust all rank numbers - Native
;;
;; - Adjust points for each player, according to results of rounds - Native
;;
;; - Print standings - Native
;;
;; - Calculate performance and ARPO (Average Rating Performance of Opponents -Native
;;   ARPO calcuations are based on the ideas of Miguel Brozos, Marco A. Campo,
;;   Carlos Díaz and Julio González
;;   eio.usc.es/pub/julio/desempate/Performance_Recursiva.htm
;;
;; - Export ELO in FEDA (Spanish Chess Federation) format - with python
;;
;; - Do pairings - with bbpPairings.exe. In order for this to work,
;;                 remember to add XXR and XXCfields in the file with the number
;;                 of rounds of the tournament.
;;
;; TODO:
;; ---------------------------------
;;
;; - Write the add players from file function in ELISP.
;; - Insert results from a results file created with a pairing program.
;;   Add the date in the "132" line and the results in the "001" lines.
;; - Add empty round. Ask for date create empty space in the players lines.
;;   Add the date in the "132" line.
;; - Add the rank number and the position automatically when adding players.
;; - Add team.
;; - Add player to team. Prompt for team and player number.
;; - Generate pgn file for a round or the whole tournament.
;; - Reorder the players list
;; - Error handling
;; - Make the interface more friendly
;; You will find more information in www.dggandara.eu/arbitools.htm

;;;; ChangeLog:

;; 2019-05-12  David Gonzalez Gandara  <dggandara@member.fsf.org>
;; 
;; 	* packages/arbitools/arbitools.el: Applied some suggested code tweaks
;; 
;; 2019-05-10  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>
;; 
;; 	* packages/arbitools/arbitools.el (arbitools--verbose-output): New
;; 	function
;; 
;; 	(arbitools-insert-result, arbitools-get-player-ci)
;; 	(arbitools-get-player-opponents, arbitools-get-player-performance)
;; 	(arbitools-calculate-arpo): Use it.
;; 
;; 2019-05-10  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>
;; 
;; 	* packages/arbitools/arbitools.el: Various code tweaks
;; 
;; 	Silence compiler warnings when compiling with lexical-binding, mostly by
;; 	removing unused variables. Remove redundant `save-excursion` around
;; 	`with-current-buffer`.
;; 	(arbitools-fill-players-info): Don't use `add-to-list` on local vars.
;; 	(arbitools-calculate-points): Don't repeatedly call thing-at-point.
;; 	(arbitools-get-player-opponents): Avoid let-binding `maxlength` and
;; 	`numberofrounds` to dummy initial values only to immediately set them. 
;; 	Use the loop's index variable instead of computing it by hand in
;; 	`roundcount`.  Don't use `add-to-list` on local vars.
;; 	(arbitools-get-player-played-points): Simplify with DeMorgan's
;; 	(AND (not A) (not B)) == (not (or A B)), and then consolidate
;; 	(or (= x ..) (= x ..) ...) into a `member` test. Use the loop's index
;; 	variable instead of computing it by hand in
;; 	`roundcount`.
;; 	(arbitools-get-player-performance): Use the loop's index variable 
;; 	instead of computing it by hand in `roundcount`.
;; 	(arbitools-calculate-arpo): Use the loop's index variable instead of 
;; 	computing it by hand in `roundcount`.  Also use `member`.
