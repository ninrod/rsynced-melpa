This package provides D-Bus bindings, major modes and interactive commands
for working with systemd from within Emacs.

systemd-mode.el provides major modes for all systemd unit file types.

systemctl.el provides interactive commands for managing units and
their status.  Similar to the command-line "systemctl" tool,
working with remote hosts is supported.  TRAMP is used to visit
configuration files of remote instances of systemd.

Last, but not least, this library, systemd.el, provides
semi-autogenerated functions and generalized setters for the
systemd D-Bus API.  They have been generated using tools from
systemd-codegen.el.
