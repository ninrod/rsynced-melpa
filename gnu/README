This directory contains most of the source code of the GNU ELPA packages.

Each directory in here corresponds to a package, which can be
either a single-file package or a multifile package.

A nightly cron job refreshes the GNU ELPA archive from this repository.

This cron job only creates a new package when the "version" of a package
is modified.  This means that you can safely work on the next version here
without worrying about the unstable code making it to GNU ELPA, and simply
update the "version" when you want to release the new code.
