A major-mode that uses original PHP lexer tokens for syntax coloring and indentation
making it easier to spot errors in syntax.

Also includes full support for PSR-1 and PSR-2 indentation and imenu.
Improved syntax table in comparison with old PHP major-mode.

For flycheck support run `(phps-mode-flycheck-setup)'.
