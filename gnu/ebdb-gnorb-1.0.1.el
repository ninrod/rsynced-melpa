Setting it to the symbol 'seen will collect the messages most

collect the most recent messages by Date header.

In other words, if this variable is set to `received', and a
record's messages field is already full of recently-received
messages, opening a five-year-old message (for instance) from
this record will not push a link to the message into the field."
