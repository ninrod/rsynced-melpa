#+TITLE: relint.el

Relint (regular expression lint) scans elisp files for mistakes in
regexps, including deprecated syntax and bad practice. It also checks
the regexp-like arguments to ~skip-chars-forward~ and
~skip-chars-backward~.

* Usage

Check a single file:

: M-x relint-file

Check all .el files in a directory tree:

: M-x relint-directory

Check current buffer:

: M-x relint-current-buffer

From batch mode:

: emacs -batch -l relint.el -f relint-batch FILES-AND-DIRS...

where directories are scanned recursively.
(Options for finding relint and xr need to be added after
~-batch~, either ~-f package-initialize~ or ~-L DIR~.)

In the ~*relint*~ buffer, pressing "g" will re-run the same check.

* Installation

From [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/relint.html][GNU ELPA]]:

: M-x package-install RET relint RET

Relint requires the package [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/xr.html][xr]]; install it from GNU ELPA.

* What the diagnostics mean

- Unescaped literal `X' ::
A special character is taken literally because it occurs in a position
where it does not need to be backslash-escaped. It is good style to do
so anyway (assuming that it should occur as a literal character).

- Escaped non-special character `X' ::
A character is backslash-escaped even though this is not necessary and
does not turn it into a special sequence. Maybe the backslash was in
error, or should be doubled if a literal backslash was expected.

- Duplicated `\' inside character alternative ::
Backslashes are not special inside ~[...]~; they have no escaping
power, and do not need to be escaped in order to include a literal
backslash.

- Repetition of repetition ::
A repetition construct is applied to an expression that is already
repeated, such as ~a*+~ (? counts as repetition here). Such
expressions can be written with a single repetition and often indicate
a different mistake, such as missing backslashes.

- Reversed range `Y-X' matches nothing ::
Ranges where the last character precedes the first cover no characters
at all (not even the endpoints). Usually, they are caused by a
misplaced hyphen.

- Character `B' included in range `A-C' ::

A range includes a character that also occurs individually. This is
often caused by a misplaced hyphen.

- Ranges `A-M' and `D-Z' overlap ::
Two ranges have at least one character in common. This is often caused
by a misplaced hyphen.

- Two-character range `A-B' ::
A range only consists of its two endpoints, since they have
consecutive character codes. This is often caused by a misplaced
hyphen.

- Duplicated character class `[:class:]' ::
A character class occurs twice in a single character alternative or
skip set.

- Duplicated alternative branch ::
The same expression occurs in two different branches, like in ~A\|A~.
This has the same effect of only including it once.

- Uncounted repetition ::
The construct ~A\{,\}~ repeats A zero or more times which was probably
not intended.

- Implicit zero repetition ::
The construct ~A\{\}~ only matches the empty string, which was
probably not intended.

- Suspect `[' in char alternative ::
This warning indicates badly-placed square brackets in a character
alternative, as in ~[A[B]C]~. A literal ~]~ must come first (possibly
after a negating ~^~).

- Literal `-' not first or last ::
It is good style to put literal hyphens last in character alternatives
and skip sets, to clearly indicate that it was not intended as part of
a range.

- Repetition of zero-width assertion ::
A repetition operator was applied to a zero-width assertion, like ~^~ or
~\&lt;~, which is completely pointless. The error may be a missing
escaping backslash.

- Repetition of expression matching an empty string ::
A repetition operator was applied to a sub-expression that could match
the empty string; this is not necessarily wrong, but these run very
slowly on Emacs's regexp engine. Consider rewriting them in a form
where the repeated expression cannot match the empty string.

Example: ~\(?:a*b*\)*~ is very slow but equivalent to the much faster
~\(?:a\|b\)*~.

Another example: ~\(?:a?b*\)?~ is better written ~a?b*~. 

In general, ~A?~, where ~A~ matches the empty string, can be
simplified to just ~A~.

- Unnecessarily escaped `X' ::
A character is backslash-escaped in a skip set despite not being one
of the three special characters ~-~ (hyphen), ~\~ (backslash) and ~^~
(caret). It could be unnecessary, or a backslash that should have been
escaped.

- Single-element range `X-X' ::
A range in a skip set has identical first and last elements. It is
rather pointless to have it as a range.

- Stray `\' at end of string ::
A single backslash at the end of a skip set is always ignored; double it
if you want a literal backslash to be included.

- Suspect skip set framed in `[...]' ::
A skip set appears to be enclosed in ~[...]~, as if it were a regexp.
Skip sets are not regexps and do not use brackets. To include the
brackets themselves, put them next to each other.

- Suspect character class framed in `[...]' ::
A skip set contains a character class enclosed in double pairs of
square brackets, as if it were a regexp. Character classes in skip
sets are written inside a single pair of square brackets, like
~[:digit:]~.

- Empty set matches nothing ::
The empty string is a skip set that does not match anything, and
is therefore pointless.

- Negated empty set matches anything ::
The string ~"^"~ is a skip set that matches anything, and is therefore
pointless.

- `X' cannot be used for arguments to `F' ::
An expression that looks like a regexp was given as an argument to
a function that expects a skip-set.

- Value from `X' cannot be spliced into `[...]' ::
An expression that looks like a regexp was used to form a string where
it is surrounded by square brackets, as if it were building a
character alternative. Regexps are not valid inside character
alternatives; they use a different syntax.

* Bugs

The recognition of regexps is done by ad-hoc rules; the simplistic
method employed means that many errors will go undetected.

Still, if you believe that a flawed regexp could have been discovered
but wasn't, please report it as a bug. Reports of false positives and
crashes are of course equally welcome.
