;;
;; Easily use and navigate multiple shell buffers, including remote shells.
;; Fundamentally, multishell is the function `multishell-pop-to-shell' -
;; a la `pop-to-buffer' - plus a keybinding. Together, they enable you to:
;;
;; * Get to the input point from wherever you are in a shell buffer,
;;   ... or to any of your shell buffers, from anywhere inside emacs.
;;
;; * Use universal arguments to launch and choose among alternate shell buffers,
;;   ... and change which is the current default.
;;
;; * Easily restart disconnected shells, or shells from prior sessions
;;   ... the latter from Emacs builtin savehist minibuf history persistence
;;
;; * Append a path to a new shell name to launch a shell in that directory,
;;   ... and use a path with Emacs tramp syntax to launch a remote shell -
;;   for example:
;;
;;   * `#root/sudo:root@localhost:/etc` for a buffer named "#root" with a
;;     root shell starting in /etc.
;;
;;   * `/ssh:example.net:/` for a shell buffer in / on example.net.
;;     The buffer will be named "*example.net*".
;;
;;   * `#ex/ssh:example.net|sudo:root@example.net:/etc` for a root shell
;;     starting in /etc on example.net named "*#ex*".
;;
;;   * 'interior/ssh:gateway.corp.com|ssh:interior.corp.com:' to go via
;;     gateway.corp.com to your homedir on interior.corp.com.  The buffer
;;     will be named "*interior*". You could append a sudo hop, and so on.
;;
;; * Thanks to tramp, file visits from the shell will seamlessly be in
;;   the auspices of the target account, and relative to the current
;;   directory, on the host where the shell is running.
;; 
;; See the `multishell-pop-to-shell` docstring for details.
;;
;; Customize-group `multishell' to select and activate a keybinding and set
;; various behaviors. Customize-group `savehist' to preserve buffer
;; names/paths across emacs restarts.
;;
;; Please use
;; [the multishell repository](https://github.com/kenmanheimer/EmacsMultishell)
;; issue tracker to report problems, suggestions, etc.
;;
;; (NOTE - tramp sometimes fails to open specifically a remote shell to
;; sudo to a homedir, eg `/ssh:example.net|sudo:root:` or
;; `/ssh:example.net|sudo:root:~`. Once it fails for a specific path, that
;; path won't work for the rest of the session. Non-homedir remote access
;; isn't disrupted. You can always work around this by switching to an
;; explicit, non-homedir remote path when the problem occurs, and then
;; cd'ing to wherever, including your homedir, in the remote shell.)
;;
;; Change Log:
;;
;; * 2016-01-22 1.0.6 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - Add multishell-version function.
;;   - Tweak commentary/comments/docstrings.
;;   - Null old multishell-buffer-name-history var, if present.
;; * 2016-01-16 1.0.5 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - History now includes paths, when designated.
;;   - Actively track current directory in history entries that have a path.
;;     Custom control: multishell-history-entry-tracks-current-directory
;;   - Offer to remove shell's history entry when buffer is killed.
;;     (Currently the only UI mechanism to remove history entries.)
;;   - Fix - prevent duplicate entries for same name but different paths
;;   - Fix - recognize and respect tramp path syntax to start in home dir
;;     - But tramp bug, remote|sudo to homedir, often fails, gets wedged.
;;   - Simplify history var name, migrate existing history if any from old name
;; * 2016-01-04 1.0.4 Ken Manheimer - Released to ELPA
;; * 2016-01-02 Ken Manheimer - working on this in public, but not yet released.
;;
;; TODO:
;;
;; * Isolate tramp's sporadic failure to connect to remote|sudo+homedir
;;   syntax
;;   (eg, /ssh:xyz.com|sudo:root@xyz.com: or /ssh:xyz.com|sudo:root@xyz.com:~)
;; * Find suitable, internally consistent ways to tidy completions, eg:
;;   - first list completions for active shells, then present but inactive,
;;     then historical
;;   - some way for user to toggle between presenting just buffer names vs
;;     full buffer/path
;;     - without cutting user off from easy editing of path
;; * Try minibuffer field boundary at beginning of tramp path, to see whether
;;   the field boundary magically enables tramp path completion.
;; * Assess whether deletion of history entry via kill-buffer is sufficient.

(defun multishell-pop-to-shell (&optional arg)
  "Easily navigate to and within multiple shell buffers, local and remote.

Use universal arguments to launch and choose between alternate
shell buffers and to select which is default.  Append a path to
a new shell name to launch a shell in that directory, and use
Emacs tramp syntax to launch a remote shell.

Customize-group `multishell' to set up a key binding and tweak behaviors.

==== Basic operation:

 - If the current buffer is shell-mode (or shell-mode derived)
   buffer then focus is moved to the process input point.

   \(You can use a universal argument go to a different shell
   buffer when already in a buffer that has a process - see
   below.)

 - If not in a shell buffer (or with universal argument), go to a
   window that is already showing the (a) shell buffer, if any.

   In this case, the cursor is left in its prior position in the
   shell buffer. Repeating the command will then go to the
   process input point, per the first item in this list.

   We respect `pop-up-windows', so you can adjust it to set the
   other-buffer/same-buffer behavior.

 - Otherwise, start a new shell buffer, using the current
   directory as the working directory.

If a buffer with the resulting name exists and its shell process
was disconnected or otherwise stopped, it's resumed.

===== Universal arg to start and select between named shell buffers:

You can name alternate shell buffers to create or return to using
single or doubled universal arguments:

 - With a single universal argument, prompt for the buffer name
   to use (without the asterisks that shell mode will put around
   the name), defaulting to 'shell'.

   Completion is available.

   This combination makes it easy to start and switch across
   multiple shell restarts.

 - A double universal argument will prompt for the name *and* set
   the default to that name, so the target shell becomes the
   primary.

   See `multishell-primary-name' for info about preserving the
   setting across emacs restarts.

===== Select starting directory and remote host:

The shell buffer name you give to the prompt for a universal arg
can include an appended path. That will be used for the startup
directory. You can use tramp remote syntax to specify a remote
shell. If there is an element after a final '/', that's used for
the buffer name. Otherwise, the host, domain, or path is used.

For example:

* '#root/sudo:root@localhost:/etc' for a buffer named \"#root\" with a
  root shell starting in /etc.

* '/ssh:example.net:/' for a shell buffer in / on example.net; the buffer
  will be named \"*example.net*\".

* '#ex/ssh:example.net|sudo:root@example.net:/etc' for a root shell
  starting in /etc on example.net named \"*#ex*\".

* 'interior/ssh:gateway.corp.com|ssh:interior.corp.com:' to go
  via gateway.corp.com to your homedir on interior.corp.com.  The
  buffer will be named \"*interior*\". You could append a sudo
  hop to the path, combining the previous example, and so on.

Thanks to tramp, file visits from the shell, and many common
emacs activities, like dired, will seamlessly be in the auspices
of the target account, and relative to the current directory, on
the host where the shell is running.

\(NOTE - tramp sometimes fails to open specifically a remote shell
to sudo to a homedir, eg `/ssh:example.net|sudo:root:` or
`/ssh:example.net|sudo:root:~`. Once it fails for a specific
path, that path won't work for the rest of the
session. Non-homedir remote access isn't disrupted. You can
always work around this by switching to an explicit, non-homedir
remote path when the problem occurs, and then cd'ing to wherever,
including your homedir, in the remote shell. Non-homedir initial
paths aren't disrupted.)

You can change the startup path for a shell buffer by editing it
at the completion prompt. The new path will be preserved in
history but will not take effect for an already-running shell.

To remove a shell buffer's history entry, kill the buffer and
affirm removal of the entry when prompted.

===== Activate savehist to retain shell buffer names and paths across Emacs restarts:

To have emacs maintain your history of shell buffer names and paths,
customize the savehist group to activate savehist."

;; 	multishell - remove plain file copy to replace it with a subtree clone
;; 
;; 2016-01-04  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>
;; 
;; 	multishell - remove custom var
;; 	multishell-non-interactive-process-buffers
;; 
;; 	Multishell should only be concerned with shell-mode and shell-mode 
;; 	derived buffers. Clarify that, and remove obsoleted 
;; 	multishell-non-interactive-process-buffers. That var wasn't being 
;; 	properly used, anyway - the residual var
;; 	non-interactive-process-buffers was mistakenly being used, it's now
;; 	removed, too.
;; 
;; 2016-01-04  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>
;; 
;; 	multishell - refactor for name-then-path, and use a valid release
;; 	number.
;; 
;; 	Hopefully this update is out there before anyone gets used to the old 
;; 	path-then-name format. (I haven't seen it in list-packages, but someone 
;; 	indicated that it might be out.)
;; 
;; 2016-01-04  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>
;; 
;; 	multishell - V. 0. Change "multishell:" to "multishell-", use
;; 	everywhere.
;; 
;; 	For ELPA conformance.
;; 
;; 	I'm also changing the version number to 0 to defer initial release. I 
;; 	discovered a big, user-exposed change I want to make, and need to iron 
;; 	it out before anyone gets used to the previous format.
;; 
;; 2016-01-03  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>
;; 
;; 	multishell.el - Remove (redundant) maintainer line, fix remote cd
;; 	ordering.
;; 
;; 	Also, remove redundant requires.
;; 
;; 2016-01-03  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>
;; 
;; 	multishell - Use actual email address, rather than obscured, in
;; 	packaging.
;; 
;; 2016-01-02  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>
;; 
;; 	multishell - new package
;; 
;; 	Author: Ken Manheimer <ken dot manheimer at gmail...> Version: 1.0.0 
;; 	Maintainer: Ken Manheimer <ken dot manheimer at gmail...> Created: 1999
;; 	-- first public availability Keywords: processes URL:
;; 	https://github.com/kenmanheimer/EmacsUtils
;; 
;; 	Commentary:
;; 
;; 	Easily use and manage multiple shell buffers, including remote shells. 
;; 	Fundamentally, multishell is the function `multishell:pop-to-shell -
;; 	like pop-to-buffer - plus a keybinding. Together, they enable you to:
;; 
;; 	* Get to the input point from wherever you are in a shell buffer,
;; 	* ... or to a shell buffer if you're not currently in one.
;; 	* Use universal arguments to launch and choose among alternate shell
;; 	buffers,
;; 	* ... and select which is default.
;; 	* Prepend a path to a new shell name to launch a shell in that
;; 	directory,
;; 	* ... and use a path with Emacs tramp syntax to launch a remote shell.
;; 
;; 	Customize-group `multishell` to select and activate a keybinding and
;; 	set various behaviors.
;; 
;; 	See the pop-to-shell docstring for details.
